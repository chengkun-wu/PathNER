<TextWithNodes>7641692:Delineation of the <Node id="27"/>CD28 signaling cascade<Node id="49"/> was found to involve protein tyrosine kinase activity, followed by the activation of phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase.
7641692:These findings should be useful for therapeutic strategies and the development of immunosuppressants targeting the <Node id="295"/>CD28 costimulatory pathway<Node id="321"/> .
7542591:The results identify functionally distinct epitopes on the CD4 coreceptor involved in activation of the <Node id="436"/>Ras/protein kinase C and calcium pathways<Node id="477"/> .
7719937:Several recent studies have implicated Jak kinases in the <Node id="546"/>signaling pathway induced by IL-2<Node id="579"/>.
7643015:These data indicate that IL-2 and IL-12 may have distinct signaling pathways leading to the induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF <Node id="715"/>gene expression<Node id="730"/>, and that the NK3.3 cell line may serve as a novel model for dissecting the biochemical and molecular events involved in these pathways.
7623828:A functional <Node id="889"/>T-cell receptor signaling pathway<Node id="922"/> is required for p95vav activity.
7623828:The role of p95vav in <Node id="986"/>TCR-mediated signaling<Node id="1008"/> processes is unclear.
7623828:In contrast, NFAT activation by a G-protein-coupled receptor is not modulated by p95vav overexpression, suggesting that the effect is specific to the <Node id="1189"/>TCR signaling pathways<Node id="1211"/> .
7623828:To further dissect p95vav involvement in <Node id="1263"/>TCR signaling<Node id="1276"/> , we analyzed various Jurkat mutants deficient in <Node id="1327"/>TCR signaling<Node id="1340"/> function or TCR expression and showed that an intact <Node id="1394"/>TCR signaling pathway<Node id="1415"/> is required for p95vav to function.
7623828:Taken together, our data suggest that p95vav plays an important role at an yet unidentified proximal position in the <Node id="1577"/>TCR signaling cascade<Node id="1598"/> .
7744799:These results indicate that Epo acts at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels on the TAL1 locus in Friend virus-induced erythroblasts and establish a link between <Node id="1786"/>Epo signaling<Node id="1799"/> mechanisms and a member of a family of transcription factors involved in the differentiation of diverse cell lineages.
7604283:Constitutively activated <Node id="1952"/>Jak-STAT pathway<Node id="1968"/> in T cells transformed with HTLV-I.
7604283:In HTLV-I-infected cord blood lymphocytes, the transition from IL-2-dependent to IL-2-independent growth correlated with the acquisition of a constitutively activated <Node id="2180"/>Jak-STAT pathway<Node id="2196"/> , which suggests that this pathway participates in HTLV-I-mediated T cell transformation.
7613138:The interleukin-5/receptor interaction activates Lyn and Jak2 tyrosine kinases and propagates signals via the Ras-Raf-1-MAP kinase and the <Node id="2434"/>Jak-STAT pathways<Node id="2451"/> in eosinophils.
7638186:These data, and the recent demonstration of JAK phosphorylation by IL-12, identify a rapid signal-transduction pathway likely to mediate IL-12-induced <Node id="2627"/>gene expression<Node id="2642"/>.
7541794:Activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases is an important aspect of <Node id="2721"/>signal transduction<Node id="2740"/> mediated by integrins.
7541794:These observations indicate that the Syk tyrosine kinase may be an important component of an <Node id="2865"/>integrin signaling pathway<Node id="2891"/> in monocytic cells, leading to activation of NF-kappa B and to increased levels of cytokine messages.
7769834:Taken together, these findings suggest that PWM is able to initiate an intracytoplasmic signalling cascade and EGR-1 induction in normal human B cells.
7706710:WIN 53071 inhibited IL-2 production induced in the <Node id="3213"/>calcium-dependent PMA and ionomycin pathway<Node id="3256"/> .
8522361:Synergy between signal transduction pathways is obligatory for expression of c-fos in B and T cell lines: implication for c-fos control via surface immunoglobulin and T cell antigen receptors.
8522361:Expression of the protooncogene c-fos is controlled by <Node id="3523"/>three main regulatory pathways involving kinase C, cAMP, and calcium<Node id="3591"/>.
7759875:Yet these same cells do initiate early <Node id="3640"/>TCR-mediated signaling<Node id="3662"/> events , such as <Node id="3680"/>generation of inositol phosphates<Node id="3713"/> and increased intracellular calcium.
7759875:The <Node id="3763"/>generation of second messengers<Node id="3794"/> in T cells normally leads to downstream signaling that results in transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene.
7540942:Thus, CD30-CD30L interactions mediate the induction of HIV expression by a <Node id="3989"/>kappa B-dependent pathway<Node id="4014"/> that is independent of TNF.
7706235:Furthermore, we demonstrate that p21ras is essential for <Node id="4108"/>NO-induced downstream signaling<Node id="4139"/> , such as <Node id="4150"/>NF-kappa B activation<Node id="4171"/>, and that endogenous NO can activate p21ras in the same cell.
7636179:However, TGF-beta 1 did not induce dephosphorylation of pRb in EBV (or LMP-1)-positive cells as opposed to EBV-negative cells, suggesting a dichotomy in the <Node id="4399"/>TGF-beta 1 signaling pathway<Node id="4427"/> leading to separable gene regulatory and growth inhibitory responses.
7739562:Coupling of a signal response domain in I kappa B alpha to multiple <Node id="4574"/>pathways for NF-kappa B activation<Node id="4608"/>.
7739562:Alanine substitutions introduced at two serine residues positioned within this N-terminal regulatory region of I kappa B alpha also yielded constitutive repressors that escaped from Tax-induced turnover and that potently inhibited immune activation <Node id="4867"/>pathways for NF-kappa B induction<Node id="4900"/>, including those initiated from antigen and cytokine receptors.
7730364:Moreover, the data comparing the effects of activated Ras and PKC mutants suggest that PKC-alpha, p21ras, and PKC-epsilon are not positioned linearly on a single signal transduction pathway .
7888666: <Node id="5174"/>Interleukin-5 signaling<Node id="5197"/> in human eosinophils involves JAK2 tyrosine kinase and Stat1 alpha.
7888666:Human eosinophils are one of the most important target cells for IL-5 and were used here to study <Node id="5372"/>IL-5 signaling<Node id="5386"/> in a primary human cell.
7888666:These data show for the first time that molecular mechanisms of <Node id="5484"/>IL-5 signaling<Node id="5498"/> in human eosinophils involve members of the JAK kinase family as well as members of the Stat family.
7602114:The activation of the <Node id="5630"/>Jak-STAT 1 signaling pathway by IL<Node id="5664"/>-5 in eosinophils.
7602114:The objective of this study was to investigate the involvement of the newly discovered <Node id="5778"/>Jak-STAT pathway<Node id="5794"/> in the <Node id="5802"/>IL-5 signal transduction<Node id="5826"/> mechanism .
7602114:Thus, we demonstrated that IL-5 activated the <Node id="5893"/>Jak 2-STAT 1 signaling pathway<Node id="5923"/> in eosinophils.
7602114:We speculate that the <Node id="5970"/>Jak 2-STAT 1 pathway<Node id="5990"/> may be involved in the activation of IL-5-inducible genes in eosinophils.
7884865:The mechanisms by which LMP-1 upregulates these proteins is unknown, but it is plausible that LMP-1 modifies signal transduction pathways that result in the activation of one or more transcription factors that ultimately regulate <Node id="6303"/>transcription<Node id="6316"/> of oncogenic genes.
7923175:Recent data suggest that the poor induction of a T-cell response to human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may be related to alterations in signal transduction pathways .
7720085:These data suggest that ALD cause transient but significant changes in <Node id="6589"/>T cell transmembrane signaling<Node id="6619"/> , although some events induced by stimulation with anti-CD3 antibodies are not induced by ALD.
7526398:Separation of oxidant-initiated and redox-regulated steps in the <Node id="6788"/>NF-kappa B signal transduction pathway<Node id="6826"/> .
7526398:Studies presented here show that overall <Node id="6878"/>NF-kappa B signal transduction<Node id="6908"/> begins with a parallel series of stimuli-specific pathways through which cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha), oxidants (hydrogen peroxide and mitomycin C), and phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) individually initiate signaling.
7526398:Since internal sites of oxidant production have been shown to play a key role in the cytokine-stimulated activation of NF-kappa B, and since tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities are known to be altered by oxidants, these findings suggest that intracellular redox status controls NF-kappa B activation by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation event(s) within the common step of the <Node id="7547"/>NF-kappa B signal transduction pathway<Node id="7585"/> .
7622191:In toto, these results suggest that TG induces IL-2R alpha in human T cells through a <Node id="7682"/>PKC-independent pathway<Node id="7705"/> .
7836389:Altogether these data indicate that, in 7TD1 cells, IL-6 controls junB <Node id="7787"/>transcription<Node id="7800"/> in a biphasic fashion by means of two separate transduction pathways .
7989745:Our knowledge of the intracellular signaling pathways coupled to this receptor is incomplete.
7869038:We have used mutants of these kinases and phosphatases (gamma B*CaM-K and delta CaM-AI, respectively) to explore their relative role in cytokine gene <Node id="8132"/>transcription<Node id="8145"/> and their interactions with <Node id="8174"/>PKC-dependent signaling<Node id="8197"/> systems .
7525701:The activation is rapid and is mediated through a <Node id="8266"/>tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway<Node id="8299"/> .
7525701:Our results define the NF-kappa B system as an intermediate event in <Node id="8379"/>CD40 signaling<Node id="8393"/> and suggest that the <Node id="8415"/>CD40 pathway<Node id="8427"/> can influence the expression of B cell-associated genes with NF-kappa B consensus sites.
8012110:Murine B lymphocytes, adipocytes, and olfactory neurons contain a DNA-binding protein that participates in the regulation of genes encoding tissue-specific components of <Node id="8695"/>signal transduction<Node id="8714"/> .
8015553:Activation of the dPRL promoter construct in these undifferentiated cells could however be induced by the addition of cAMP, in the absence of progesterone, suggesting that a signal transduced through the <Node id="8929"/>cAMP signaling pathway<Node id="8951"/> is a primary inducer of decidual PRL <Node id="8989"/>gene expression<Node id="9004"/>.
8157958:Moreover, its rapid activation suggests it may have a wider role within <Node id="9086"/>signal transduction<Node id="9105"/> cascades in lymphocytes.
8051172:ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase, CD45, and T cell receptor involvement in UV- and H2O2- induced <Node id="9226"/>T cell signal transduction<Node id="9252"/> .
8051172:These results suggest that <Node id="9290"/>UV -induced signal transduction<Node id="9321"/> is mediated via cell surface receptors that normally respond to biological stimulation, whereas H2O2 is able to partially bypass this requirement.
8196620:TF is the primary cellular initiator of the <Node id="9521"/>coagulation protease cascades<Node id="9550"/> .
8151786:To define the mechanism of action of the Nef protein, the signal transduction pathways which may be affected in T cells by constitutive expression of the nef gene were examined.
8151786:Because the Nef protein does not affect the surface expression of the CD3-TCR complex, we conclude that the Nef protein down-regulates the transcriptional factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in T cells in vitro through an effect on the <Node id="9975"/>TCR-dependent signal transduction pathway<Node id="10016"/> .
7911088:Sensitivity against various enzyme inhibitors suggests that components of the signal transduction pathway are shared by all three cytokines.
7512079:To analyze the <Node id="10191"/>signal transduction<Node id="10210"/> mechanisms induced by RA, we first compared the effects of PMA and RA on the <Node id="10288"/>expression of genes<Node id="10307"/> which are known to be regulated during monocytic differentiation.
7522304: <Node id="10383"/>Calcium signalling<Node id="10401"/> in T cells stimulated by a cyclophilin B-binding protein.
7522304:When bound to cyclophilin, cyclosporin A binds and inactivates the key signalling intermediate calcineurin.
7522304:To identify potential cellular homologues of cyclosporin A that might regulate <Node id="10663"/>calcium signalling<Node id="10681"/> , we have cloned human genes encoding cyclophilin B-binding-proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system.
7522304:CAML appears to be a new participant in the <Node id="10838"/>calcium-signal transduction pathway<Node id="10873"/> , implicating cyclophilin B in <Node id="10905"/>calcium signalling<Node id="10923"/> , even in the absence of cyclosporin.
7511050: Retroviral vector-mediated transduction of RA receptor (RAR alpha) into this HL-60R subclone completely restored the sensitivity of these cells to ATRA in terms of their ability to express CD38.
8207643:To characterize mechanisms responsible for these LIF effects, levels of HIV mRNA, activation of the DNA binding protein nuclear factor (NF)-kB, signal transduction pathways , and potential interactions with other cytokines were analyzed.
7510691:The interleukin-8 AP-1 and kappa B-like sites are genetic end targets of <Node id="11493"/>FK506-sensitive pathway<Node id="11516"/> accompanied by calcium mobilization.
8077662:Induction of IL-8 expression in T cells uses the <Node id="11611"/>CD28 costimulatory pathway<Node id="11637"/> .
7524519: <Node id="11649"/>MHC class II signaling<Node id="11671"/> in B-cell activation [see comments]
7524519:In this review, Paul Scholl and Raif Geha discuss recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms of <Node id="11820"/>MHC class II signaling<Node id="11842"/> and analyse their role in human B-cell activation.
7945272:These observations suggest that v-abl may be inhibiting the differentiation of B cells by blocking these two crucial elements in the maturation pathway .
7520093:Our data also suggest that whilst NF-kappa B may be an essential component of <Node id="12142"/>LMP1 signal transduction<Node id="12166"/> , other cell-specific factors may be required to effect some functions of the viral protein.
8144878:The implications for <Node id="12289"/>T cell receptor signaling<Node id="12314"/> and HIV-1 <Node id="12325"/>gene expression<Node id="12340"/> are considered.
7520914:Recently, investigators have hypothesized that <Node id="12412"/>CD14-mediated signaling<Node id="12435"/> is effected through a receptor-associated tyrosine kinase (TK), suggesting a multicomponent receptor model of <Node id="12546"/>LPS signaling<Node id="12559"/> .
7520914:These results imply that TK activity is not obligatory for <Node id="12629"/>CD14-mediated signal transduction<Node id="12662"/> to occur in response to LPS.
7917514:Role of HIV-1 Nef expression in activation pathways in CD4+ T cells.
7917514:The role of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) Nef protein in <Node id="12845"/>T cell activation pathways<Node id="12871"/> was investigated using a Jurkat CD4+ cell line stably transfected with a Nef expression vector.
8108127:Overproduction of NFKB2 (lyt-10) and c-Rel: a mechanism for HTLV-I Tax-mediated trans-activation via the <Node id="13081"/>NF-kappa B signalling pathway<Node id="13110"/> .
8108127:We propose that NFKB2 synthesis and processing allows continuous nuclear expression of an otherwise cytoplasmic protein and, in conjunction with overexpression of c-Rel, NFKB2 alters the <Node id="13308"/>NF-kappa B signalling pathway<Node id="13337"/> and contributes to leukemic transformation of T cells by HTLV-I.
8298127:In FCS- liquid-suspension culture supplemented with saturating Ep level and low-dose IL-3/GM-CSF, adult HPC undergo unilineage erythropoietic differentiation: Here again, treatment with high-dose RA induces a shift from the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation pathway .
8298127:These results indicate that RA directly inhibits the erythroid differentiation program at the level of early adult HPC, and may lead to a shift from the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation pathway .
8916959:PML appears to be transcriptionally regulated by class I and II interferons, which raises the possibility that interferons modulate the function and growth and differentiation potential of normal myeloid cells and precursors by activating <Node id="14147"/>PML-dependent pathways<Node id="14169"/> .
8950029:The effects of Ara-C on JNK activity may be mediated through secondary response pathways .
8892903:The transmembrane domains are well conserved, but there is striking sequence divergence of the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain essential for B-cell immortalization and interaction with the <Node id="14472"/>tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling pathway<Node id="14520"/> .
8892903:The conserved TRAF3 binding sites in LMP1 and the CD30 Hodgkin's <Node id="14596"/>disease<Node id="14603"/> marker provides further evidence that a <Node id="14644"/>TRAF3-mediated signal transduction pathway<Node id="14686"/> may be important in malignant transformation.
8307982:Experiments using inhibitors of protein <Node id="14781"/>kinase C, protein kinase A, and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways<Node id="14847"/> revealed that G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA expression involves activation of an <Node id="14944"/>H7-inhibitable pathway<Node id="14966"/> .
8307982:Furthermore, maximal G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA expression could be enhanced by co-stimulation with LPS or MDP, suggesting that different receptors and/or transduction pathways were involved.
8283032:Previous studies have suggested that gangliosides have an important role in <Node id="15271"/>cell signaling<Node id="15285"/> and recognition.
9022666:It is thus generally believed that the pancreatic endocrine-lineage possesses the ability to mature along a differentiation pathway that shares many characteristics with those of neuronal differentiation.
8910360:Characterization of a <Node id="15546"/>CD43/leukosialin-mediated pathway<Node id="15579"/> for inducing <Node id="15593"/>apoptosis<Node id="15602"/> in human T-lymphoblastoid cells.
8910360:Since peripheral blood T-lymphocytes express cryptic epitopes for mAb J393, these findings demonstrate the existence of a tightly regulated <Node id="15784"/>CD43-mediated pathway<Node id="15805"/> for inducing <Node id="15819"/>apoptosis<Node id="15828"/> in human T-cell lineages.
8947512:Based upon these results we propose that alpha-interferon through its receptor initiates <Node id="15952"/>phosphatidic acid dependent signalling<Node id="15990"/> which in turn regulates the affinity of 47 kDa sterol regulatory element binding factor as well as LDL-receptor gene <Node id="16108"/>transcription<Node id="16121"/> in lymphocytes from CML patients.
8970984:A 40-fold stimulation of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity mediated by four tandem repeats of the SNE could be induced within 2 h (and up to 250-fold within 6 h) after addition of TPA in DNA-transfected U-937 cells, indicating that the stimulation appeared likely to be a <Node id="16445"/>true protein kinase C-mediated signal transduction<Node id="16495"/> event rather than a differentiation response.
8892614: <Node id="16551"/>Apoptosis signaling pathways<Node id="16579"/> in normal T cells: differential activity of Bcl-2 and IL-1beta-converting enzyme family protease inhibitors on glucocorticoid- and Fas-mediated cytotoxicity.
8892614:These results suggest that peripheral T cells use distinct <Node id="16805"/>apoptosis signaling pathways<Node id="16833"/> with differential sensitivity to Bcl-2 and interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme family protease inhibitors.
8011280:Among these properties are NF-kappa B's rapid posttranslational activation in response to many pathogenic signals, its direct participation in cytoplasmic/nuclear signaling , and its potency to activate <Node id="17152"/>transcription<Node id="17165"/> of a great variety of genes encoding immunologically relevant proteins.
8943389:We show that triggering of <Node id="17273"/>CD40 signaling pathway<Node id="17295"/> (s) by CD40 ligands expressed on L cells led to strong activation of an NF-kappaB-controlled beta-globin reporter gene in primary B lymphocytes from transgenic mice.
8943389:These results indicate that stimulation of <Node id="17513"/>CD40 signaling pathways<Node id="17536"/> exerts a long-lasting stimulatory effect on both the <Node id="17590"/>transcription<Node id="17603"/> and nuclear translocation of RelB.
8892610:These results demonstrate that CD40, like sIg, may employ PKC in producing select outcomes, that individual B cell receptors may signal downstream events via <Node id="17805"/>both PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways<Node id="17852"/>, and that multiple signal transduction pathways may be used to activate the expression of closely related genes.
8943365:The constitutive association of TRAFs with LMP1 through the aa 187 to 231 domain which is important in NF-kappaB activation and primary B-lymphocyte growth transformation implicates TRAF aggregation in <Node id="18176"/>LMP1 signaling<Node id="18190"/> .
8906805:Lack of <Node id="18209"/>IL-12 signaling<Node id="18224"/> in human allergen-specific Th2 cells.
8906805:The IL-12 nonresponsiveness of the Th2 clones was further evident by the total lack of IL-12-induced phosphorylation of STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-4), a transcription factor that is typically involved in <Node id="18504"/>IL-12 signaling<Node id="18519"/> .
8191547:A second messenger cascade involved is the <Node id="18573"/>inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate/calcium pathway<Node id="18617"/> which responds over the same rapid time course.
8986719:Signaling via IL-2 and IL-4 in JAK3-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency lymphocytes: <Node id="18766"/>JAK3-dependent and independent pathways<Node id="18805"/> .
8875942:Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR-1) and CD95 (also called Fas or APO-1) are cytokine receptors that engage the <Node id="18933"/>apoptosis pathway<Node id="18950"/> through a region of intracellular homology, designated the "death domain." Another death domain-containing member of the TNFR family, death receptor 3 (DR3), was identified and was shown to induce both <Node id="19153"/>apoptosis<Node id="19162"/> and activation of nuclear factor kappaB.
8875942: <Node id="19213"/>DR3 signal transduction<Node id="19236"/> is mediated by a complex of intracellular signaling molecules including TRADD, TRAF2, FADD, and FLICE.
8106512:These data suggest that interferon regulatory factor 1 not only triggers the activation of the <Node id="19443"/>interferon signal transduction pathway<Node id="19481"/> , but also may play a role in limiting the duration of this response by activating the <Node id="19569"/>transcription<Node id="19582"/> of IRF-2.
8890196: <Node id="19602"/>CD14-mediated signal pathway<Node id="19630"/> of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide in human gingival fibroblasts.
8887687:p21(ras), a guanine nucleotide binding factor, mediates <Node id="19773"/>T-cell signal transduction<Node id="19799"/> through <Node id="19808"/>PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways<Node id="19850"/>.
8887687:A later result of inhibition of this activation pathway by p21(ras) was down-regulation of the activity of the transcription factor AP-1 and subsequent coordinate reductions in IL-<Node id="20040"/>2 gene expression<Node id="20057"/> and protein production.
8955094:Mutation of tyrosines 492/493 in the kinase domain of ZAP-70 affects multiple <Node id="20168"/>T-cell receptor signaling pathways<Node id="20202"/> .
8955094:The protein-tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 is implicated, together with the Src kinase p56(lck), in controlling the early steps of the <Node id="20340"/>T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling cascade<Node id="20387"/> .
8108414:These findings thus reveal the presence of a second inducible autoregulated inhibitory pathway that helps ensure the rapid but transient action of nuclear NF-kappa B.
8910398:Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the <Node id="20632"/>JAK-STAT signaling pathway<Node id="20658"/> .
8702466:These results suggest that, while lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of inflammatory mediators requires tyrosine kinase activity, tyrosine kinase activity is not obligatory for <Node id="20849"/>lipopolysaccharide signal transduction<Node id="20887"/> .
8764027:Chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection of myeloid cells disrupts the autoregulatory control of the <Node id="21012"/>NF-kappaB/Rel pathway<Node id="21033"/> via enhanced IkappaBalpha degradation.
8700228:The close homology of the basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding and dimerization domain of HLF to that of the CES-2 cell-death specification protein of Caenorhabditis elegans suggests a model of leukaemogenesis in which E2A-HLF blocks an early step within an evolutionarily conserved <Node id="21374"/>cell-death pathway<Node id="21392"/> .
8977934:The multiple alterations observed on the various biochemical pathways may appear as a consequence of a unique deleterious mechanism more fundamentally related to the process of senescence such as the inability to cope with <Node id="21626"/>oxidative stress<Node id="21642"/>.
8816467:The presence of an active CRE site in the bcl-2 promoter implies that the regulation of bcl-2 expression is linked to a signal transduction pathway in B cells.
8877725:The IFN-gamma mRNA is induced/inhibited in these cell types by a wide variety of extracellular signals, thus implicating a number of diverse, yet convergent signal transduction pathways in its transcriptional control.
8695800:p38 and p63 may provide a docking site for Grb2, thereby linking Grb2 SH3-binding proteins SOS1, SLP-76, and p120 to downstream signalling events .
8874184:Studies on unicellular and paired daughter cell culture unequivocally indicate that the shift is mediated by modulation of the HPC differentiation program to the granulopoietic pathway (rather than RA-induced down-modulation of multipotent /erythroid/monocytic HPC growth coupled with recruitment of granulocytic HPCs).
8794888:In this report, we demonstrate that the corresponding mutations in murine calcineurin render the <Node id="22627"/>T cell receptor signal transduction cascade<Node id="22670"/> CsA resistant in human Jurkat T cells.
8816436:The human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene is one of the earliest genes transcribed after the stimulation of a B cell through its antigen receptor or via the <Node id="22888"/>CD-40 pathway<Node id="22901"/> .
8757326:However, the reduced expression of these proteins was not the result of a global <Node id="22993"/>TCR/CD3-signaling<Node id="23010"/> defect because CD3 cross-linking induced an equivalent increase in intracellular-free calcium ions, as well as NFATp dephosphorylation, translocation to the nucleus, and DNA binding in both normal and anergic T cells.
8871623:A major obstacle in understanding the signaling events that follow CD28 receptor ligation arises from the fact that CD28 acts as a costimulus to TCR engagement, making it difficult to assess the relative contribution of CD28 signals as distinct from those of the TCR.
8871623:Using selective inhibitors, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the CD28-mediated induction of AP-1 and NF-kappaB.
8871623:These data suggest that in activated normal T cells, CD28-derived signals can stimulate proliferation at least in part via NF-kappaB and AP-1 generation, and that this response uses both <Node id="23838"/>acidic sphingomyelinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-linked pathways<Node id="23911"/> .
8759733:Inhibition of T lymphocyte activation by cAMP is associated with down-regulation of two parallel <Node id="24019"/>mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways<Node id="24060"/> , the extracellular signal-related kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase.
8759733:The induction of T cell proliferation requires signals from the TCR and a co-receptor molecule, such as CD28, that activate parallel and partially cross-reactive signaling pathways .
8759733:To further analyze potential cross points between positively and negatively regulating signaling pathways in T cells, we tested the effects of activators of the adenylate cyclase or PKA on two parallel <Node id="24533"/>mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways<Node id="24584"/> mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase.
8759733:Our results suggest that PKA inhibits T cell activation by interfering with multiple events along the two signaling pathways operating downstream of the TCR and the CD28 co-receptor molecules.
8709637: <Node id="24880"/>Interleukin-7 signaling<Node id="24903"/> in human B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and murine BAF3 cells involves activation of STAT1 and STAT5 mediated via the interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain.
8709637:Activation of the <Node id="25105"/>JAK/STAT pathway<Node id="25121"/> has been implicated in <Node id="25145"/>IL-7R signaling<Node id="25160"/> .
8709637:IL-7 also induced STAT/DNA binding in BCP-ALL cases that failed to proliferate in response to IL-7, suggesting that the ability of IL-7R to activate the <Node id="25324"/>JAK/STAT pathway<Node id="25340"/> per se is not sufficient for proliferation induction.
8709637:The data further indicate that the IL-7R alpha chains are directly involved in the activation of JAKs and STATs and have a major role in proliferative signaling in precursor B cells.
8691123: <Node id="25595"/>CaMKIV/ Gr signaling<Node id="25615"/> is associated with transcriptional activation of c-fos but is independent of p21ras or calcineurin.wch
8790367:Thus, select genetic aberrations in the <Node id="25767"/>apoptotic pathway<Node id="25784"/> reveal a cell autonomous coregulation of activation.
8759721:Inhibition of transcription factor Stat1 activity in mononuclear cell cultures and T cells by the <Node id="25944"/>cyclic AMP signaling pathway<Node id="25972"/> .
8759721:Stimulation of the <Node id="26002"/>cAMP signal transduction pathway<Node id="26034"/> , which skews cytokine production toward a Th2 pattern, resulted in the preferential suppression of Stat1 activity.
8759721:Our results demonstrate the regulation of STAT activity by a signaling pathway that regulates the T cell functional phenotype and is distinct from the <Node id="26310"/>cytokine-activated Janus kinase-STAT signaling pathway<Node id="26364"/> .
8898948:These observations establish the importance of different signal transducing pathways leading to CD40 activation of B lymphocytes.
8751937:The combined data lend additional support to the proposal that spirochetal lipoproteins and LPS initiate monocyte activation via different cell surface events but that the signaling pathways ultimately converge to produce qualitatively similar cellular responses.
8843413:GR expression levels were shown to be rate-limiting for initiating the <Node id="26856"/>apoptotic pathway<Node id="26873"/> , and a positive correlation between steroid sensitivity and GR-mediated induction of an integrated mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) LTR reporter gene was observed.
8670897:Multiple <Node id="27056"/>p21ras effector pathways<Node id="27080"/> regulate nuclear factor of activated T cells.
8670897:The transcription factor, Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) is a major target for <Node id="27226"/>p21ras and calcium signalling pathways<Node id="27264"/> in the IL-2 gene and is induced by p21ras signals acting in synergy with calcium/calcineurin signals.
8670897:Expression of dominant negative N17Rac also prevents TCR and p21ras activation of NFAT, but without interfering with the <Node id="27496"/>ERK-2 pathway<Node id="27509"/> .
8670897:Thus, p21ras regulation of NFAT in T cells requires the activity of multiple effector <Node id="27606"/>pathways including those regulated by MAPKK-1/ERK-2 and Rac-1<Node id="27667"/>.
8683106:Differential utilization of Janus kinase-signal transducer activator of <Node id="27749"/>transcription<Node id="27762"/> signaling pathways in the stimulation of human natural killer cells by IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-alpha.
8864127:The discovery of these signaling pathways has led to important new insights into their role in lymphocyte maturation, as it has emerged that mutations in the genes encoding both gamma c and JAK3 result in similar forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).
8864127:In this review we examine the structure and function of cytokine receptors and the signaling pathways involved in their regulation of <Node id="28275"/>gene expression<Node id="28290"/>.
8877104:Yet, little is known as to how the <Node id="28335"/>RA and VitD3 receptor network<Node id="28364"/> operates in hematopoietic cells, and whether receptor interactions can explain the interplay between the <Node id="28470"/>RA -and VitD3 -signaling pathways<Node id="28503"/> during differentiation.
8877104:Therefore, we analyzed the expression, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity of the endogenous RA and VitD3 receptors [retinoic acid receptors (RARs), retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and VitD3 receptor (VDR)] in the U-937 cell line, in which RA and VitD3 induce distinct monocytic differentiation pathways .
8877104:These results demonstrate a complex role for VitD3 in modifying the retinoid differentiation pathway and may have implications for differentiation-inducing therapy of hematopoietic tumors.
8695838:Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces immediate effects in monocytes by activation of the <Node id="29168"/>Janus kinase (JAK2) and STAT transcription factor (STAT5) pathway<Node id="29233"/> .
8620546:Thus, these results show that age-related impairments in the activation of AP-1 and NF-AT are closely associated with decreased expression of IL-2 and further suggest that aberrancies in the signaling pathways important for the induction of transcriptionally active c-Fos/c-Jun AP-1 may contribute to the impaired activation of NF-AT.
8609418:Our data suggest that IL-13 utilizes <Node id="29624"/>IL-4R and its signaling pathway<Node id="29655"/> , and JAK2 may play an important role in the function of IL-4R and IL-13R in colon cancer cells.
8631809:Activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells in a <Node id="29816"/>cyclosporin A-resistant pathway<Node id="29847"/> .
8631809:We demonstrate here, however, that NFAT can be activated, and significant levels of IL-2 can be produced by the <Node id="29970"/>CsA-resistant CD28-signaling pathway<Node id="30006"/> .
8605941:The activation of T cells requires engagement of the T cell receptor/CD3 complex and co-stimulatory molecules, and results in the triggering of several signaling pathways which lead rapidly to the nuclear translocation of several transcription factors, such as nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B and NF-AT.
8605941:Appearance of the STAT1 factor is significantly reduced in the presence of cyclosporin A, and blocked by cycloheximide, indicating that its activation is dependent upon a protein(s) synthesized in response to initial signaling events .
8557975:We conclude that the <Node id="30590"/>MAP kinase signal transduction pathway<Node id="30628"/> consisting of Raf-1, MEK1, and ERK1 and ERK2 functions in the stimulation IL-2 gene <Node id="30713"/>transcription<Node id="30726"/> in activated T lymphocytes.
8609393:To gain further knowledge of the IL-12R complex and the <Node id="30819"/>IL-12 signal transduction pathway<Node id="30852"/> in cytotoxic T cells, we studied a number of human T cell lines that had been transformed to permanent growth with Herpesvirus saimiri, an oncogenic virus of nonhuman primates.
8609393:Using these T cells as a model of <Node id="31072"/>IL-12 signal transduction<Node id="31097"/> , we confirmed that these events involve members of the Janus kinase family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases JAK2, TYK2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 4.
8639461:In part, this may be due to altered intercellular signalling systems and intracellular <Node id="31369"/>signal transduction<Node id="31388"/> .
8628295:The relevance of these molecular events to <Node id="31442"/>BCR signal transduction<Node id="31465"/> and antigen-stimulated B-cell-mediated immune responses is discussed.
8605359:A mutant Tax protein deficient in transactivation of genes by the <Node id="31610"/>nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway<Node id="31644"/> was unable to induce transcriptional activity of IL-1alpha promoter-CAT constructs, but was rescued by exogenous provision of p65/p50 NF-kappaB.
8605359:These data suggest a general role for Tax induction of IL-1alpha gene <Node id="31868"/>transcription<Node id="31881"/> by the <Node id="31889"/>NF-kappaB pathway<Node id="31906"/> .
8631962:Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor stimulates <Node id="31977"/>JAK2 signaling pathway<Node id="31999"/> and rapidly activates p93fes, STAT1 p91, and STAT3 p92 in polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
8631962:These results identify a new signal transduction pathway activated by GM-CSF and provide a mechanism for rapid activation of <Node id="32221"/>gene expression<Node id="32236"/> in GM-CSF-stimulated PMN.
8634418:The RAR-RXR as well as the <Node id="32298"/>RXR-RXR pathway<Node id="32313"/> is involved in signaling growth inhibition of human CD34+ erythroid progenitor cells.
8634418:Using synthetic ligands to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) that selectively bind and activate RAR-RXR or RXR-RXR dimers, respectively, we dissected the involvement of the two <Node id="32614"/>retinoid response pathways<Node id="32640"/> in the regulation of normal myeloid and erythroid progenitor cell growth.
8634418:Thus, the <Node id="32733"/>RAR-RXR response pathway<Node id="32757"/> can signal growth inhibition of normal bone marrow myeloid and erythroid progenitor cells.
8634418:In addition, we demonstrate a unique involvement of the <Node id="32913"/>RXR-RXR pathway<Node id="32928"/> in mediating growth inhibition of erythroid but not myeloid progenitor cells.
8628274:Recent studies indicate that HTLV-1 Tax targets IkappaBalpha to the <Node id="33083"/>ubiquitin-proteasome pathway<Node id="33111"/> .
8622883:We demonstrate that loss of p16 causes upregulation of this <Node id="33182"/>DNA precursor pathway<Node id="33203"/> enzyme via activation of E2F by a mechanism involving retinoblastoma protein.
8634413:A signal transduction pathway activated by many cytokines has recently been elaborated.

8562955:Stimulation through the Fas/APO-1 receptor results in <Node id="33832"/>apoptosis<Node id="33841"/> through an incompletely characterized signaling pathway .
8562955:More is known regarding <Node id="33932"/>signal transduction<Node id="33951"/> events that occur after ligation of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR).
8562955:Although prior studies suggest a role for protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases in <Node id="34118"/>Fas signaling<Node id="34131"/> , we report here that Fas ligation induces <Node id="34175"/>apoptosis<Node id="34184"/> in T cells deficient in either CD45 or Lck.
8562955:We show that stimulation with a synthetic ceramide analog results in JNK activation as well as <Node id="34332"/>apoptosis<Node id="34341"/>, suggesting ceramide release occurs proximal to JNK activation in <Node id="34408"/>Fas signaling<Node id="34421"/> .
8562955:Our data suggest that although CD45 and Lck are not required for <Node id="34497"/>Fas signaling<Node id="34510"/> , JNK activation may play an important role transducing distal signals that lead to <Node id="34595"/>apoptosis<Node id="34604"/> after Fas ligation.
8642282:In B7.1-positive B cells, this element bound several members of the NF-kappaB family, transcription factors already implicated in signal transduction pathways relevant to B7.1 expression.
8617766:These results suggest that the temporal control of c-Jun and c-Fos may be regulated through the <Node id="34925"/>ubiquitinylation pathways<Node id="34950"/> , and the ubiquitinylation of c-Jun and c-Fos may in turn be regulated in response to the heterodimerization between them and the cooperation between E220K and E3 mediated polyubiquitinylation.
8558011:Involvement of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of <Node id="35216"/>transcription and protein kinase C signaling pathways<Node id="35269"/> .
10485875:Here, we studied the role of serine/threonine phosphatases in <Node id="35343"/>STAT3 signaling<Node id="35358"/> in human antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell lines and cutaneous T cell lymphoma lines, expressing a constitutively activated STAT3.
10452760: Signal transduction pathways triggered by the FcepsilonRIIb receptor (CD23) in human monocytes lead to nuclear factor-kappaB activation.
10452760:We have focused on the study of the signal transduction pathways triggered by CD23 in human monocytes and the promonocytic cell line U937.
10452760:CONCLUSIONS: NF-kappaB is the main transcription factor involved in the signal transduction pathway of CD23 in monocytes.
8555464:Thus, our data indicate that Stat3 and Stat5 may be involved in <Node id="35985"/>signal transduction<Node id="36004"/> after ligand binding to c-Mpl and that this event may have a role in megakaryopoiesis/thrombopoiesis or possibly a mature platelet function such as aggregation.
8809472:Damage to the genes encoding proteins that function in intracellular signaling , <Node id="36255"/>transcription<Node id="36268"/>, or regulation of the <Node id="36291"/>cell cycle<Node id="36301"/> has been identified and linked at varying degrees to the progression of certain lymphoid malignancies.
10454636:These results reveal a new link between the <Node id="36458"/>dopamine system<Node id="36473"/>, <Node id="36475"/>cytokine signaling pathway<Node id="36501"/> and regulation of <Node id="36520"/>gene expression<Node id="36535"/> via the involvement of NF-kappaB in T cells and PBMC.
10430944:We have determined that the <Node id="36627"/>JAK/STAT pathway<Node id="36643"/> positively regulates Qp activity.
10430944:The data imply that <Node id="36707"/>JAK/STAT signaling<Node id="36725"/> has a role in EBV-associated malignancies.
8523529:Although little information as to what signal transduction pathways mediate NF-kappa B activation in monocytes-macrophages is available, our previous work indicated that classical protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes were not involved in the HIV-mediated NF-kappa B activation.
8523529:Altogether, these results suggest that atypical PKC isoenzymes, including PKC-zeta, participate in the signal transduction pathways by which <Node id="37201"/>HIV infection<Node id="37214"/> results in the activation of NF-kappa B in human monocytic cells and macrophages.
10482545:Our findings suggest that constitutive expression of Bcl-x(L) induced by Tax through the <Node id="37395"/>NF-kappaB pathway<Node id="37412"/> contributes to the inhibition of <Node id="37446"/>apoptosis<Node id="37455"/> in CTLL-2 cells after IL-2 deprivation.
10438903:Moreover, we provide evidence that TCR/CD3 and IL-2 induce Stat3 activation via distinct signaling pathways .
10430922:Two such clusters were found to have patterns that correlated with variation in cell proliferation rates and with activation of the <Node id="37756"/>IFN-regulated signal transduction pathway<Node id="37797"/> , respectively.
8598210:The activation is rapid and transient and is mediated through a <Node id="37886"/>cyclosporin A-insensitive pathway<Node id="37919"/> .
8598210:Furthermore, this signaling pathway appears not to rely on protein kinase C.
8734787:Stimulation of the T-cell antigen <Node id="38049"/>receptor-CD3 complex signaling pathway<Node id="38087"/> by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate is mediated by inhibition of CD45: evidence for <Node id="38186"/>two interconnected Lck/Fyn- or zap-70-dependent signaling pathways<Node id="38252"/>.
8734787:The tyrosine phosphatase specific inhibitor pervanadate is a potent activator of T lymphocytes through induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream events of the activation cascade .
10499538:Vitamin D analogs, 20-Epi-22-oxa-24a,26a,27a,-trihomo-1alpha,25(OH)2-vitamin D3, 1,24(OH)2-22-ene-24-cyclopropyl-vitamin D3 and 1alpha,25(OH)2-lumisterol3 prime NB4 leukemia cells for monocytic differentiation via nongenomic signaling pathways , involving calcium and calpain.
10499538:These data suggest that although MC903 and KH1060 may bind the VDRnuc, that the differentiative activities of these agents requires nongenomic signaling pathways .
10480426:A role for retinoic acid during neutrophil maturation has been suggested from a variety of sources. Here we present a review of the mechanism of retinoic acid receptor action and the major evidence showing that normal <Node id="39139"/>retinoid signaling<Node id="39157"/> is required for neutrophil maturation.
10430908:NF-kappaB-mediated up-regulation of Bcl-x and Bfl-1/A1 is required for <Node id="39277"/>CD40 survival signaling<Node id="39300"/> in B lymphocytes.
10430908:Inhibition of the <Node id="39346"/>NF-kappaB pathway<Node id="39363"/> by overexpression of a dominant-active inhibitor of NF-kappaB abolished CD40-induced up-regulation of both the Bfl-1 and Bcl-x genes and also eliminated the ability of CD40 to rescue Fas-induced cell death.
10430908:Furthermore, expression of physiological levels of Bcl-x protected B cells from Fas-mediated <Node id="39673"/>apoptosis<Node id="39682"/> in the absence of <Node id="39701"/>NF-kappaB signaling<Node id="39720"/> .
8561779:Inhibition of <Node id="39745"/>NF-AT signal transduction<Node id="39770"/> events by a dominant-negative form of calcineurin.
8561779:These data suggest the potential utility of agents that disrupt <Node id="39894"/>calcineurin-mediated signal transduction pathways<Node id="39943"/> by blocking formation of the catalytically active dimer of calcineurin A and B subunits.
8675228:However, <Node id="40050"/>signal transduction of IL-10<Node id="40078"/> in B cells is poorly understood.
8675228:Since this is the first report on <Node id="40154"/>IL-10 induced signal transduction<Node id="40187"/> , these data may help to identify the intracellular mechanisms by which IL-10 stimulates human B-cells.
10458769:Studies with motheaten mice, which lack the SHP1 protein tyrosine phosphatase, indicate that this enzyme plays an important negative role in <Node id="40442"/>T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling<Node id="40481"/> .
10458769:To define these targets for SHP1 we have compared the effects of constitutively active and inactive mutants of SHP1 on <Node id="40612"/>TCR signaling<Node id="40625"/> .
10458769:Therefore, we suggest that SHP1 is not actively recruited to inhibit <Node id="40706"/>TCR signaling<Node id="40719"/> induced by ligation of this receptor alone.
10477716:Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) is a pluripotent activator of inflammation by inducing a <Node id="40869"/>proinflammatory cytokine cascade<Node id="40901"/> .
10477716:These data indicate that TNFalpha induces a delayed <Node id="40965"/>ROS-dependent signalling pathway<Node id="40997"/> that is required for NF-kappaB transcriptional activation and is separable from that required for its nuclear translocation.
10477716:Further definition of this pathway will yield new insights into inflammation initiated by <Node id="41222"/>TNFalpha signalling<Node id="41241"/> .
10438457:By using Jurkat and primary human T lymphocytes, we demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of two second messengers of the <Node id="41382"/>TCR-initiated signal transduction<Node id="41415"/> , protein kinase C (PKC) and calcineurin, results in the synergistic activation of the IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK) complex but not of another putative IkappaBalpha kinase, p90(rsk).
10438457:These results indicate that within the <Node id="41644"/>TCR/CD3 signal transduction pathway<Node id="41679"/> both PKC and calcineurin are required for the effective activation of the IKK complex and NF-kappaB in T lymphocytes.
10415609:The mechanism(s) of action of GCH is under investigation, but is has been noted that they exert immune activity via the genomic pathway .
10426995:Several lipoproteins stimulated TLR-dependent <Node id="42000"/>transcription<Node id="42013"/> of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the <Node id="42057"/>production of nitric oxide<Node id="42083"/>, a powerful microbicidal pathway .
10415075:Numerous cellular and biochemical abnormalities in immune regulation have been described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including surface Ag receptor-initiated signaling events and lymphokine production.
10415075:Freshly isolated T cells from lupus patients, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and normal individuals were activated physiologically via the TCR with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs to assess proximal membrane signaling, and with PMA and a calcium ionophore (A23187) to bypass membrane-mediated signaling events .
10395652: Signaling events induced by lipopolysaccharide-activated toll-like receptor 2.
10395652:Intracellular deletion variants of TLR2 lacking C-terminal 13 or 141 aa fail to recruit IRAK, which is consistent with the inability of these mutants to transmit <Node id="42935"/>LPS cellular signaling<Node id="42957"/> .
10395652:Moreover, both deletion mutants could still form complexes with wild-type TLR2 and act in a dominant-negative (DN) fashion to block <Node id="43101"/>TLR2-mediated signal transduction<Node id="43134"/> .
10395652:These results reveal a conserved <Node id="43179"/>signaling pathway for TLR2 and IL-1Rs<Node id="43216"/> and suggest a molecular mechanism for the inhibition of TLR2 by DN variants.
10380915:Tyrphostin AG-490 inhibits <Node id="43330"/>cytokine-mediated JAK3/STAT5a/b signal transduction<Node id="43381"/> and cellular proliferation of antigen-activated human T cells.
10380915:Taken together, these findings suggest that AG-490 inhibits the <Node id="43518"/>JAK3-mediated Type II signaling pathway<Node id="43557"/> but not the <Node id="43570"/>T cell receptor-derived Type I pathway<Node id="43608"/> and possesses therapeutic potential for T cell-derived pathologies such as graft-versus-host disease, allergy, and autoimmune disorders.
10358173:Therefore, IRF-1 may be an important contributor to <Node id="43807"/>IL-12 signaling<Node id="43822"/> , and we speculate that the defective IL-12 responses seen in IRF-1-/- mice might be attributable, in part, to the absence of this transcription factor.
10233875:These results suggest that NF-kappaB activation is required for C5a-induced IL-8 <Node id="44066"/>gene expression<Node id="44081"/> and that this response is mediated primarily through a <Node id="44137"/>pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway<Node id="44172"/> .
10395671:Activation of the <Node id="44202"/>Janus kinase 3-STAT5a pathway<Node id="44231"/> after CD40 triggering of human monocytes but not of resting B cells.
10395671:The signal transduction events triggered by cross-linking of the CD40 receptor have been widely studied in B cell lines, but little is known about signaling following CD40 stimulation of monocytes and resting tonsillar B cells.
10395671:Therefore, we studied the <Node id="44573"/>CD40 pathway<Node id="44585"/> in highly purified human monocytes and resting B cells.
10381500:Genetic evidence for an additional factor required for <Node id="44706"/>erythropoietin-induced signal transduction<Node id="44748"/> .
10330189:In response to activation of the <Node id="44793"/>Wnt signaling pathway<Node id="44814"/> , beta-catenin accumulates in the nucleus, where it cooperates with LEF/TCF (for lymphoid enhancer factor and T-cell factor) transcription factors to activate <Node id="44974"/>gene expression<Node id="44989"/>.
10229231:One of the best understood <Node id="45027"/>apoptotic pathways<Node id="45045"/> occurs in T lymphocytes and is mediated by Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) interaction.
10409763:We now find that <Node id="45150"/>LMP1 signaling<Node id="45164"/> through TRADD differs from <Node id="45192"/>TNFR1 signaling<Node id="45207"/> through TRADD.
10378896: Signal transduction pathways in normal human monocytes stimulated by cytokines and mediators: comparative study with normal human neutrophils or transformed cells and the putative roles in functionality and cell biology.
10358154:We have investigated several molecular pathways that are known to be activated by IL-2 in T cells.
10358154:PNU156804 action is restricted to some signaling pathways ; it does not affect NF-kappa B activation by PMA in T cells but blocks that induced by CD40 cross-linking in B lymphocytes.
10359894:CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the <Node id="45807"/>chemokine pathways<Node id="45825"/> are modulated by DEP-PAHs at the transcriptional level, reinforcing the idea that the development of inflammatory reactions might be affected by diesel exhaust emission.
10347175:These findings suggest that the synergy between SLP-76 and Vav in regulating IL-2 <Node id="46087"/>gene expression<Node id="46102"/> reflects the cooperation between different signaling pathways .
10329626:Rel/NF-kappaB can trigger the <Node id="46206"/>Notch signaling pathway<Node id="46229"/> by inducing the expression of Jagged1, a ligand for Notch receptors.
10329626:These results demonstrate that c-Rel can trigger the <Node id="46361"/>Notch signaling pathway<Node id="46384"/> in neighboring cells by inducing jagged1 <Node id="46426"/>gene expression<Node id="46441"/>, and suggest a role for Jagged1 in B-cell activation, differentiation or function.
10377411:Consequently, inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and the expression of dominant negative mutant forms of components of the <Node id="46668"/>NF-kappaB activation pathway<Node id="46696"/> , such as IkappaBalpha or p65, prompt rapid <Node id="46741"/>apoptosis<Node id="46750"/> of T. parva-transformed T cells.
10339482:Constitutive STAT5 activity, activated through an unknown pathway not including JAK2 or EPOR, may act in concert with the constitutive <Node id="46928"/>PI3-kinase/PKB/Akt pathway<Node id="46954"/> to protect the EPO-independent HCD57-SREI cells from <Node id="47008"/>apoptosis<Node id="47017"/> and promote limited proliferation.
10367897:CBP/p300 integrates <Node id="47082"/>Raf/Rac-signaling pathways<Node id="47108"/> in the transcriptional induction of NF-ATc during T cell activation.
10357818:Molecular and biochemical approaches demonstrated that LMP1 usurps cellular signaling pathways resulting in the induction of NF-kappaB and AP-1 via two C-terminal activating regions.
10357818:These results reveal a novel activating region in the LMP1 C-terminus and identify the <Node id="47466"/>JAK/STAT pathway<Node id="47482"/> as a target of this viral integral membrane protein in B cells.
10376531:Thereafter, PML is downmodulated in late granulocytic maturation, whereas it is sustainably expressed through the <Node id="47670"/>erythroid pathway<Node id="47687"/> .
10359012:The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the <Node id="47753"/>mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway<Node id="47810"/> contributes to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced mononuclear differentiation in the human myeloblastic leukemia ML-1 cells.
10233947:In addition to activating <Node id="47987"/>transcription<Node id="48000"/> from the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) through the cyclic AMP response element binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF) family of transcription factors, Tax activates the expression of multiple cellular promoters through the <Node id="48247"/>NF-kappaB pathway<Node id="48264"/> of transcriptional activation.
10233947:These results indicate that activation of the <Node id="48351"/>CREB/ATF pathway<Node id="48367"/> by Tax is dispensable for the immortalization of T cells by HTLV-1, whereas activation of the <Node id="48462"/>NF-kappaB pathway<Node id="48479"/> may be critical.
10229820:The signaling events that link FGF receptor-1 engagement and NF-kappaB activation in Jurkat are probably distinct from the <Node id="48629"/>CD28 costimulation pathway<Node id="48655"/> , since FGF-1-induced Rel/kappaB binding proteins do not contain significant levels of c-Rel and are not identical with the CD28 response complex.
10352279:LP T cells exhibit enhanced IL-2 secretion when activated through the <Node id="48882"/>CD2 pathway<Node id="48893"/> .
10352279:Previous studies have characterized the CD28 augmentation of <Node id="48966"/>TCR-mediated signaling<Node id="48988"/> in peripheral blood T cells through transcriptional activation of an IL-2 promoter CD28 response element (CD28RE), along with enhanced mRNA stability.
10229815:These results indicate that <Node id="49177"/>CTLA-4 signaling inhibits<Node id="49202"/> events early in T cell activation both at IL-2 <Node id="49250"/>transcription<Node id="49263"/> and at the level of IL-2-independent events of the <Node id="49315"/>cell cycle<Node id="49325"/>, and does not simply oppose CD28-mediated costimulation.
10373548:Members of the recently discovered SOCS/CIS/SSI family have been proposed as regulators of <Node id="49483"/>cytokine signaling<Node id="49501"/> , and while targets and mechanisms have been suggested for some family members, the precise role of these proteins remains to be defined.
10352273:Modulation of CD28 expression: distinct regulatory pathways during activation and replicative senescence.
10229324:To determine activation status of the <Node id="49802"/>IL-2R-associated (Jak/STAT) pathway<Node id="49837"/> in the HTLV-I infected cells, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3, STAT3, and STAT5 in several HTLV-I(+) T-cell lines and in uncultured leukemic T cells isolated from patients with adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL).
10229324:Furthermore, expression of SHP-1 phosphatase which is a negative regulator of <Node id="50154"/>cytokine receptor signaling<Node id="50181"/> , was lost in most IL-2 independent cell lines (3/4) but not in the leukemic ATLL cells (0/3).
10229324:We conclude that (<Node id="50304"/>1) HTLV-I infection<Node id="50323"/> per se does not result in a constitutive phosphorylation of the Jak3, STAT3, and STAT5 proteins; (2) malignant transformation in at least some cases of ATLL does not require the constitutive, but may require IL-2-induced, activation of the <Node id="50564"/>IL-2R Jak/STAT pathway<Node id="50586"/> ; and (3) there are major differences in T-cell immortalization mechanism(s) which appear to involve SHP-1 and target molecules for rapamycin and RAD.
10373522:In T lymphocytes, the hematopoietic cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) uses <Node id="50818"/>phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase)-induced signaling pathways<Node id="50889"/> to regulate E2F transcriptional activity, a critical <Node id="50943"/>cell cycle<Node id="50953"/> checkpoint.
10373522:Our present results show that <Node id="51005"/>IL-2 -and PI 3-kinase-induced pathways<Node id="51043"/> for the regulation of E2F transcriptional activity include both rapamycin-resistant and rapamycin-sensitive components.
10364193:These results demonstrate that the DNA binding activity of STAT3 can be modulated by oxidizing agents and provide a framework to understand the effects of <Node id="51328"/>oxidative stress<Node id="51344"/> on the <Node id="51352"/>JAK-STAT signaling pathway<Node id="51378"/> .
10358756:The development and function of T lymphocytes are regulated tightly by signal transduction pathways that include specific cell-surface receptors, intracellular signaling molecules, and nuclear transcription factors.
10358756:In addition to increasing our understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate T cell development and function, these results have suggested novel targets for genetic and pharmacological manipulation of T cell immunity.
10352258:These results point out the involvement of NF-kappa B/Rel family proteins in growth signaling pathways by either regulating proteins involved in the <Node id="51998"/>IL-2 signaling<Node id="52012"/> or by functionally interfering with the <Node id="52053"/>cell cycle<Node id="52063"/> progression.
10210645: <Node id="52087"/>Endotoxin (LPS) signal transduction<Node id="52122"/> in human monocytes leads to activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and TNF-alpha release.
10192386:The mutant alleles encode cell-surface IFNgamma receptors that lack the intra-cytoplasmic domain, which, through a combination of impaired recycling, abrogated signalling and normal binding to IFNgamma exert a dominant-negative effect.
10087648:Because extinction of <Node id="52499"/>IL-12 signaling<Node id="52514"/> in early Th2 development could potentially be important in imprinting a more permanent Th2 phenotype on a population of T cells, we have also examined various parameters regulating the <Node id="52700"/>IL-12 signaling pathway<Node id="52723"/> .
10087648:Whereas IL-4 appears to repress <Node id="52767"/>functional IL-12 signaling<Node id="52793"/> through inhibition of IL-12R beta 2 expression, IFN-gamma in the mouse, and IFN-alpha in the human appear to induce IL-12R beta 2 expression and promote IL-12 responsiveness.
10206983:Inhibition of <Node id="52992"/>T cell signaling<Node id="53008"/> by mitogen-activated protein kinase-targeted hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP).
10201899:However, p38 MAPK is activated strongly and synergistically by either CD3/CD28 coligation or PMA/Ca2+ ionophore stimulation, which mimics <Node id="53245"/>TCR-CD3/CD28-mediated signaling<Node id="53276"/> .
10210322:To explore the receptor signaling pathways involved in RA-induced <Node id="53354"/>apoptosis<Node id="53363"/>, we used selective ligands for retinoic acid receptors (RARs; RO13-7410) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs; RO 25-6603).
10097788:Jeg-3 human choriocarcinoma-induced immunosuppression: downregulation of interleukin-2, interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain, <Node id="53615"/>and its Jak/Stat signaling pathway<Node id="53649"/> .
10097788:For IL-2R and signaling pathway molecule analysis , peripheral blood lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA).
10202937:Fludarabine-induced immunosuppression is associated with inhibition of <Node id="53869"/>STAT1 signaling<Node id="53884"/> .
10087181:The most characterized pathway is via <Node id="53934"/>JAK-STAT signaling<Node id="53952"/> .
10087181:Previous studies established a potential role for the Src-family kinase Lck in <Node id="54043"/>JAK-STAT signaling<Node id="54061"/> .
10087181:Therefore, this study was designed to analyze the role of Lck in <Node id="54138"/>IFN-alpha signaling<Node id="54157"/> by using the Jurkat, JCam (an Lck-defective cell line derived from Jurkat), and JCam/Lck (JCam cells with Lck restored).
10079106:Activation of leukocytes by proinflammatory stimuli selectively initiates intracellular <Node id="54376"/>signal transduction<Node id="54395"/> via sequential phosphorylation of kinases.
10086725:MDS1/EVI1 enhances <Node id="54467"/>TGF-beta1 signaling<Node id="54486"/> and strengthens its growth-inhibitory effect but the leukemia-associated fusion protein AML1/MDS1/EVI1, product of the t(3;21), abrogates growth-inhibition in response to TGF-beta1.
10086725:By using the yeast two-hybrid system, we also show that EVI1 (contained in its entirety in MDS1/EVI1 and AML1/MDS1/EVI1) physically interacts with SMAD3, which is an intracellular mediator of <Node id="54870"/>TGF-beta1 signaling<Node id="54889"/> .
10078502:Abnormalities of <Node id="54918"/>cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling<Node id="54958"/> in platelets from untreated patients with bipolar disorder.
10078502:These findings may provide clues toward understanding the involvement of <Node id="55101"/>cAMP signaling<Node id="55115"/> in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder.
10221643:Beta-catenin is the vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene Armadillo and plays roles in both <Node id="55279"/>cell-cell adhesion<Node id="55297"/> and transduction of the <Node id="55322"/>Wnt signaling cascade<Node id="55343"/> .
10221643:Here we report that in T cells, Tcf-1 also becomes transcriptionally active through interaction with beta-catenin, suggesting that the <Node id="55490"/>Wnt signal transduction pathway<Node id="55521"/> is operational in T lymphocytes as well.
10221643:This is the first demonstration that lithium can alter <Node id="55627"/>gene expression<Node id="55642"/> of Tcf-responsive genes, and points to a difference in regulation of <Node id="55712"/>Wnt signaling<Node id="55725"/> between fibroblasts and lymphocytes.
10202034:By using PD98059, we demonstrated that the <Node id="55815"/>Raf1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway<Node id="55839"/> did not affect the DNA binding of NF-kappa B but, rather, acted at the level of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B.
10202034:Our results suggest that the <Node id="55998"/>JNK pathway<Node id="56009"/> may regulate NF-kappa B-mediated gene <Node id="56048"/>transcription<Node id="56061"/> through its phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun.
10225979:Constitutive activation of an epithelial signal transducer and activator of <Node id="56200"/>transcription (STAT) pathway<Node id="56228"/> in asthma.
10225979:Cytokine effects on immunity and inflammation often depend on the transcription factors termed signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), so <Node id="56407"/>STAT signaling pathways<Node id="56430"/> are candidates for influencing inflammatory disease.
10225979:We reasoned that selective IFN responsiveness of the first STAT family member (Stat1) and Stat1-dependent immune-response genes such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), and Stat1 itself in airway epithelial cells provides a basis for detecting <Node id="56781"/>cytokine signaling<Node id="56799"/> abnormalities in inflammatory airway disease.
10225979:The results therefore provide initial evidence linking abnormal behavior of <Node id="56931"/>STAT pathways<Node id="56944"/> for <Node id="56949"/>cytokine signaling<Node id="56967"/> to the development of an inflammatory disease.
10208867:The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) participates in most signaling pathways involved in inflammation.
10208867:Together, the data demonstrate the ability of the vasoactive peptide ANG II to activate <Node id="57246"/>inflammatory pathways<Node id="57267"/> in human monocytes.
10202027: Signal transduction pathways activated in endothelial cells following infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae.
10092805:A decrease in the <Node id="57432"/>translation<Node id="57443"/> rate is observed when the cells are induced to differentiate along the monocytic/macrophage pathway or along the granulocytic pathway .
10092805:Taken together, these data provide evidence for differential regulation of the translational machinery during human myeloid differentiation, specific to the monocytic/macrophage pathway or to the granulocytic pathway .
10075873:This approach should allow for the evaluation of different intracellular signaling pathways using a combination of monoclonal reagents that are specific for native and activation modified proteins.
10075873:Application of this form of testing should prove valuable in screening for signaling defects in selected patients with recurrent infections.
10075873:In addition, this technique should permit dissection of a full range of cellular signaling pathways at the protein level.
10225377:These lipid mediators increase activity of transcription factors and expression of cytokine genes indicating a function for cytosolic phospholipase A2 in <Node id="58459"/>signal transduction<Node id="58478"/> and inflammation.
10202024:These results support our hypothesis that HCMV initiates a signal transduction pathway that leads to monocyte activation and pinpoints a potential mechanism whereby HCMV infection of monocytes can result in profound pathogenesis, especially in chronic inflammatory-type conditions.
10082134: Cobalt chloride-induced <Node id="58822"/>signaling in endothelium<Node id="58846"/> leading to the augmented adherence of sickle red blood cells and transendothelial migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells is blocked by PAF-receptor antagonist.
10082134:However, the cellular signaling pathway (s) caused by hypoxia is poorly understood.
10082134:We utilized CoCl2 as a mimetic molecule for hypoxia to study cellular signaling pathways .
10082134:Furthermore, CoCl2 also caused time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase isoform ERK2 without significantly affecting ERK1, indicating ERK2 is the preferred substrate for upstream kinase of the <Node id="59443"/>MAPK pathway<Node id="59455"/> .
10075645:Here we investigated the role and involvement of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) signal transducer molecules in <Node id="59606"/>LPS signaling<Node id="59619"/> in human dermal microvessel endothelial cells (HDMEC) and THP-1 monocytic cells.
10075645:LPS stimulation of HDMEC and THP-1 cells initiated an <Node id="59764"/>IL-1 receptor-like NF-kappaB signaling cascade<Node id="59810"/> .
10075645:In transient cotransfection experiments, dominant negative mutants of the <Node id="59896"/>IL-1 signaling pathway<Node id="59918"/> , including MyD88, IRAK, IRAK2, and TRAF6 inhibited both IL-1 -and LPS-induced NF-kappaB-luciferase activity.
10075645:LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation was not inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of TRAF2 that is involved in <Node id="60148"/>TNF signaling<Node id="60161"/> .
10075645:These findings suggest that a signal transduction molecule in the LPS receptor complex may belong to the IL-1 receptor/toll-like receptor (TLR) super family, and the <Node id="60339"/>LPS signaling cascade<Node id="60360"/> uses an analogous molecular framework for signaling as IL-1 in mononuclear phagocytes and endothelial cells.
10224470: <Node id="60480"/>Signal transduction<Node id="60499"/> through interferon-gamma receptor on human eosinophils.
10224470:But <Node id="60569"/>signal transduction<Node id="60588"/> through IFN-gammaR on eosinophils remains to be elucidated.
10224470:In this study, we examined the involvement of the <Node id="60708"/>Jak/Stat pathway in the signaling<Node id="60741"/> of eosinophils after IFN-gammaR conjugation by the ligand binding.
10224470:CONCLUSION: These data indicate that IFN-gamma affects eosinophils through its specific receptor and utilizes the <Node id="60932"/>Jak/Stat pathway<Node id="60948"/> as its mode of signaling.
10201984:Furthermore, these findings indicate that the optimal activation of T cells by IL-12 and IL-2 may depend on an interaction between the <Node id="61119"/>p38 MAP kinase and Janus kinase/STAT signaling pathways<Node id="61174"/> .
10074432:Unlike the proposed role of Cbl as a negative regulator, our results suggest that the Cbl homologue Cbl-b has a positive role in <Node id="61315"/>T-cell signaling<Node id="61331"/> , most likely via a direct interaction with the upstream kinase Zap-70.
10224278:Grf40, A novel Grb2 family member, is involved in <Node id="61463"/>T cell signaling<Node id="61479"/> through interaction with SLP-76 and LAT.
10224278:Our data suggest that Grf40 is an adaptor molecule involved in <Node id="61593"/>TCR-mediated signaling<Node id="61615"/> through a more efficient interaction than Grb2 with SLP-76 and LAT.
10207023:The pocket protein-E2F complexes are convergence points for <Node id="61753"/>cell cycle<Node id="61763"/> signaling .
10092775:Evidence for distinct intracellular signaling pathways in CD34+ progenitor to dendritic cell differentiation from a human cell line model.
10092775:Together, these findings demonstrate that cytokine or phorbol ester stimulation of KG1 is a model of human CD34+ HPC to DC differentiation and suggest that specific intracellular signaling pathways mediate specific events in DC lineage commitment.
10089566:In this study, we examined whether gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation is mediated by the previously described synergistic activation of <Node id="62324"/>cAMP and NF-kappaB pathways<Node id="62351"/> .
10089566:We also examined the involvement of other signal transduction pathways .
10089566:Specific inhibitors of p70(S6)-kinase (rapamycin), and Gi protein (pertussis toxin), prevented induction of IL-10 production by gp41 in monocytes, while inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (wortmannin) and mitogen-activated <Node id="62695"/>protein kinase (MAPK) pathway<Node id="62724"/> (PD 98059) did not.
10080908:Here we describe methods to investigate whether and how signaling agonists induce myeloid differentiation and how oncoproteins might cause AML by modulating the activity of transcription factors that are pivotal for normal myeloid development.
9973469:Fas ligand induction in human NK cells is regulated by redox through a calcineurin-nuclear factors of <Node id="63108"/>activated T cell-dependent pathway<Node id="63142"/> .
9915850:We have examined early signal transduction pathways recruited following T cell stimulation with either CD80 or CD86.
9915850:However, CD80 and CD86 also induce distinct signal transduction pathways including the tyrosine phosphorylation of CD28 and phospholipase Cgamma1 and the SH2-dependent association of phosphoinositide 3-kinase with CD28.
9548485:We hypothesized that activation of the <Node id="63545"/>protein kinase A signaling pathway<Node id="63579"/> may inhibit NF-kappaB-mediated <Node id="63611"/>transcription<Node id="63624"/> by phosphorylating proteins, such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which compete for limiting amounts of the coactivator CBP.
9548485:These results suggest that activation of the <Node id="63820"/>protein kinase A pathway<Node id="63844"/> inhibits NF-kappaB <Node id="63864"/>transcription<Node id="63877"/> by <Node id="63881"/>phosphorylating CREB<Node id="63901"/>, which competes with p65 for limiting amounts of CBP.
9933632:These data shed light on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms regulating human granulocyte <Node id="64059"/>apoptosis<Node id="64068"/> and, in particular, indicate that the transcription factor NF-kappaB plays a crucial role in regulating the physiological <Node id="64191"/>cell death pathway<Node id="64209"/> in granulocytes.
9548490:Cross-linking CD19 on early human B lineage cells induces the formation of a CD19/Vav/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complex, tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 and Vav, and activation of the <Node id="64424"/>Ras pathway<Node id="64435"/> .
9548490:These data suggest that <Node id="64470"/>CD19-mediated signal transduction<Node id="64503"/> activates different transcription factors at juxtaposed stages of B cell development that may culminate in the activation or suppression of distinct sets of genes.
9973402:The induction of clonal anergy in a T cell inhibits IL-2 secretion because of the development of a proximal <Node id="64784"/>signal transduction<Node id="64803"/> defect .
10022882:In conclusion, three different cell-specific pathways lead to NF-kappaB activation by IL-1beta: a pathway dependent on ROI production by 5-LOX in lymphoid cells, an <Node id="64987"/>ROI- and 5-LOX-independent pathway<Node id="65021"/> in epithelial cells, and a pathway requiring ROI production by NADPH oxidase in monocytic cells.
9882331:The finding of Tax mutants segregating these two pathways suggested that the <Node id="65204"/>NF-kappaB pathway<Node id="65221"/> was essential for IL-2-independent growth of CTLL-2 cells while the <Node id="65290"/>CRE pathway<Node id="65301"/> was unnecessary.
10037138:We found that: (i) both CTCF mRNA and protein are down-regulated during terminal differentiation in most cell lines tested; (ii) CTCF down-regulation is retarded and less pronounced than that of c-myc; (iii) CTCF protein is differentially phosphorylated and the phosphorylation profiles depend on the differentiation pathway .
9919536:Data obtained from studies in our laboratories demonstrate that the <Node id="65731"/>proteasome<Node id="65741"/> plays an important role in the <Node id="65773"/>inflammatory cascade<Node id="65793"/> by regulating the activation of NF-kappa B.
9497493:Blockade of this intracellular signalling event was associated with a reduction in the normal transendothelial migration response towards MCP-1.
10029589:The Megakaryocyte/Platelet-specific enhancer of the alpha2beta1 integrin gene: two tandem AP1 sites and the <Node id="66108"/>mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade<Node id="66158"/> .
10029589:The requirement for AP1 activation suggested a role for the <Node id="66230"/>mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway<Node id="66287"/> in regulating alpha2 integrin <Node id="66318"/>gene expression<Node id="66333"/>.
10029589:Inhibition of the <Node id="66362"/>MAP kinase cascade<Node id="66380"/> with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase 1, prevented the expression of the alpha2 integrin subunit in cells induced to become megakaryocytic.
10029589:We provide a model of megakaryocytic differentiation in which expression of the alpha2 integrin gene requires <Node id="66652"/>signaling via the MAP kinase pathway<Node id="66688"/> to activate two tandem AP1 binding sites in the alpha2 integrin enhancer.
9989503:Functional association of Nmi with Stat5 and Stat1 in <Node id="66825"/>IL-2 -and IFNgamma-mediated signaling<Node id="66862"/> .

9916078:It was previously demonstrated that stimulation of monocytic cells with either LPS or LAMPf led to a series of common downstream signaling events , including the activation of protein tyrosine kinase and of <Node id="67423"/>mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades<Node id="67464"/> .
9886419:Pretreatment of PBMCs with pertussis toxin blocked the functions of C3a and C3a(desArg), indicating that the actions of these two molecules are mediated by a <Node id="67633"/>G protein-coupled pathway<Node id="67658"/> .
9390691:Here we identify the <Node id="67690"/>cell cycle<Node id="67700"/> regulator E2F as an IL-2 target in T lymphocytes and <Node id="67754"/>PI3K as the critical signaling pathway<Node id="67792"/> .
9390691:We eliminate both <Node id="67821"/>Stat5 and Raf/MEK pathways<Node id="67847"/> from E2F regulation.

9234696:Both signal cascades contribute to the induction of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene during T-cell activation.
9234696:Prominent protein kinase cascades are those that activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases.

9271588:Thus, EBV binding to its cellular receptor on resting B cells triggers an <Node id="81183"/>NF-kappaB-dependent intracellular signaling pathway<Node id="81234"/> which is required for infection.
9210372:That the signal transduction pathways used by the cytokines IL-2 and IL-15 are identical would suggest that these cytokines have redundant roles in lymphoid development; instead, IL-2 is the guardian of thymus-derived T-cell homeostasis, while interleukin-15 promotes extrathymic development of T and NK cells.
9151898:This contrasts with findings in alpha- and beta- herpesvirus systems (herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus) where viral interference with the <Node id="81732"/>antigen-processing pathway<Node id="81758"/> during lytic infection renders immediate early and early proteins much less immunogenic.

9015216:These results indicate a lack of involvement of Jak kinases in signaling by the G-CSFR in neutrophils, and suggest utilization of alternative signal transduction pathways distinct from those in proliferating cells.
9015216:Activation of the <Node id="84573"/>Jak-Stat pathway<Node id="84589"/> correlates with proliferative signaling by the G-CSFR and requires the membrane-proximal box 1 PXP motif, which is conserved in members of the cytokine receptor superfamily.
9130477:BSAP is unique among the transcription factors that regulate epsilon germline expression, because it is B cell specific, and is at the merging point of two signalling pathways that are critical for IgE switching.

9127005:Involvement of G protein in the activation of <Node id="86944"/>MAPK pathway<Node id="86956"/> by TCC was indicated by inhibition of Raf-1 and ERK1 kinase activity, as well as the <Node id="87042"/>DNA synthesis<Node id="87055"/> by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin.
9127005:Overexpression of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 carboxyl-terminal peptide in JY25 cells also inhibited Raf-1 and <Node id="87228"/>ERK1 activity<Node id="87241"/>, indicating a direct involvement of G betagamma subunits in the <Node id="87306"/>signal transduction<Node id="87325"/> generated through activation of <Node id="87358"/>MAPK pathway<Node id="87370"/> by TCC assembly in the plasma membrane.
9136989:Taken together these results demonstrate that the IK protein plays a key role in the constitutive expression of MHC class II antigens and that inhibition induced by IK is upstream of CIITA in this regulatory pathway .
9065737:The <Node id="87649"/>transduction pathway<Node id="87669"/> leading to NF-kappaB activation in U937 cells involved the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as demonstrated by the concomitant inhibitory effects of antioxidants on NF-kappaB activation and the emission of a fluorescent probe reacting intracellularly with hydrogen peroxide.
9065737:This <Node id="87984"/>ROS pathway<Node id="87995"/> was also characterized by the use of other inhibitors.
9065737:However, the <Node id="88072"/>NF-kappaB activation pathway<Node id="88100"/> involving the acidic sphingomyelinase of the endolysosomial membrane did not seem to participate in the LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in U937 cells.
9007200:Thus, the binding of V3 loop of gp120 to the cell surface molecule(s) appears to affect <Node id="88349"/>intracellular IL-2 signaling<Node id="88377"/> , which leads to the suppression of IL-2-induced T cell growth
9115394:CONCLUSIONS: Our results establish that PI 3-kinase can both positively and negatively regulate T-cell function, and uncover a previously unrecognized function for PI 3-kinase in T cells as a selective negative regulator of <Node id="88673"/>TCR-signalling<Node id="88687"/> events and therefore as a determinant of T-cell homeostasis.

9032271:We also report that the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-derived Tax trans-activator induces NF-kappaB activity in 1.3E2, suggesting that this viral protein does not operate via the defective pathway .
9121455:Finally, we demonstrate that deletion in NFATx1 of the mapped 60 residues leads to its nuclear translocation independent of <Node id="90068"/>calcium signaling<Node id="90085"/> .
9121455:Our results support the model proposing that the N-terminal domain confers <Node id="90171"/>calcium-signaling<Node id="90188"/> dependence on NFATx1 transactivation activity by regulating its intracellular localization through a protein module that associates with calcineurin and is a target of its phosphatase activity.

9029146:From our results, we conclude that Rap1 activation in platelets is an important common event in early agonist-induced signalling , and that this activation is mediated by an increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration
9120310:We demonstrate that: 1) RANTES promoter activity is up-regulated by PMA plus ionomycin, coexpression of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B, the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, and the <Node id="90995"/>CD28 costimulatory pathway<Node id="91021"/> ; 2) the RANTES promoter region contains four NF-kappa B binding sites at positions -30, -44, -213, and -579 relative to the <Node id="91147"/>transcription<Node id="91160"/> start site; 3) one site (-213) is an NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) binding site that also has weak affinity to NF-kappa B, and the most distal site (-579) also serves as a CD28-responsive element; and 4) mutation on any of those NF-kappa B sites or coexpression of I kappa B alpha (cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-kappa B) markedly reduced the promoter activity.
9122243:Our results implicate NFIL3/E4BP4 (nuclear factor regulated by IL-3/adenovirus E4 promoter binding protein) in a distinct <Node id="91664"/>growth factor-regulated signaling pathway<Node id="91705"/> that is responsible for the survival of early B-cell progenitors, and whose alteration by E2A-HLF leads to childhood B lineage leukemia.

9062356:Pertussis toxin blocked FMLP-induced activation of the <Node id="92147"/>p42/44 (ERK) MAPk cascade<Node id="92172"/> , but not that of <Node id="92191"/>p38 MAPk<Node id="92199"/>.
9062356:These results demonstrate distinct patterns of intracellular signaling for two chemoattractants and suggest that selective activation of intracellular signaling cascades may underlie different patterns of functional responses.
9135552:Molecular differences of the A6H molecule or distinct regulation of the A6H transduced <Node id="92531"/>AP-1 activation pathway<Node id="92554"/> may exist in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations.
9005984:Nonetheless, only a limited portion of the cytoplasmic domain of gamma(c) is necessary for <Node id="92704"/>IL-7R signal transduction<Node id="92729"/> .
9005984:Furthermore, replacement of the gamma(c) cytoplasmic domain by a severely truncated erythropoeitin receptor does not affect measured <Node id="92873"/>IL-7R signaling<Node id="92888"/> events .
9005984:These findings support a model in which gamma(c) serves primarily to activate <Node id="92984"/>signal transduction<Node id="93003"/> by the IL-7R complex, while IL-7R alpha determines specific signaling events through its association with cytoplasmic signaling molecules.
9878608:Here we show that deregulated expression of a single viral gene, ORF 50, which encodes a transactivator able to selectively upregulate delayed-early viral genes, suffices to disrupt latency and induce the <Node id="93356"/>lytic gene cascade<Node id="93374"/> in latently infected B cells.
9835626: Cellular pathways for induction of <Node id="93449"/>programmed cell death (PCD)<Node id="93476"/> have been identified, but little is known about specific extracellular matrix processes that may affect <Node id="93581"/>apoptosis<Node id="93590"/> along those pathways.
9815258:Strength of <Node id="93633"/>T cell receptor (TCR) signaling<Node id="93664"/> , coreceptors, costimulation, antigen-presenting cell type, and cytokines all play crucial roles in determining the efficiency with which type 2 T lymphocytes (Th2, Tc2) develop from uncommitted precursors.
9143685:Furthermore, Ikaros-null thymocytes hyperproliferate in response to <Node id="93948"/>T cell receptor (TCR) signaling<Node id="93979"/> ; within days after their appearance in the thymus, clonally expanding populations are detected.
9143685:In addition, lack of natural killer cells and selective defects in gamma delta T cells and dendritic antigen-presenting cells point to Ikaros as an essential factor for the establishment of early branchpoints of the <Node id="94301"/>T cell pathway<Node id="94315"/> .

9860137:As occurs for HL-60 cell differentiation induced by high phorbol ester concentration, the ciprofibrate-induced phorbol ester-dependent differentiation of HL-60 cells proceeded through the monocytic/macrophage pathway and induced the phosphorylation of proteins with similar molecular weights suggesting that increased protein kinase C activity may be involved in the effect.
9852070:When this membrane-proximal TRAF6 interaction domain was deleted, <Node id="94899"/>RANK-mediated NF-kappaB signaling<Node id="94932"/> was completely inhibited while c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation was partially inhibited.
9834272:CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal epithelial cells initiate an inflammatory response with resulting neutrophil-mediated tissue damage in response to E. histolytica infection; this <Node id="95204"/>inflammatory cascade<Node id="95224"/> can be blocked by inhibiting the <Node id="95258"/>transcription<Node id="95271"/> of genes regulated by nuclear factor kappaB.

8995243:As a first step toward elucidating the function of Cbl in <Node id="95887"/>TCR-initiated signaling<Node id="95910"/> , we evaluated the ability of wild-type Cbl or a transforming Cbl mutant (70Z/3) to induce transcriptional activation of a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) element derived from the interleukin 2 (IL2) promoter in transiently cotransfected Jurkat-TAg T cells.
8995243:These results implicate Cbl in <Node id="96219"/>Ras-dependent signaling pathways<Node id="96251"/> which lead to NFAT activation.
9893043: <Node id="96292"/>CD2 signalling<Node id="96306"/> induces <Node id="96315"/>phosphorylation of CREB<Node id="96338"/> in primary lymphocytes.
9893043:Therefore, we investigated <Node id="96398"/>CD2 and CD3 receptor-mediated signalling<Node id="96438"/> in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
9893043:These data indicate specific modulation of the CREB/ATF-1 family of <Node id="96575"/>transcription<Node id="96588"/> factors by the <Node id="96604"/>CD2 signalling pathway<Node id="96626"/> and suggest CD2 receptor modulation of CRE-mediated <Node id="96679"/>transcription<Node id="96692"/> following ligand engagement (e.g. cell-to-cell contact).
9843840:This model is of particular value for exploring physical stress-induced signaling pathways , as well as for testing the effects of novel ventilatory strategies or adjunctive substances aimed at modulating cell activation induced by mechanical ventilation.
9834081: Signaling pathways mediated by the TNF- and cytokine-receptor families target a common cis-element of the IFN regulatory factor 1 promoter.
9834081:Targeting of the IRF-1 GAS is not confined to activation via CD40 but extends to other stimuli that mimic the <Node id="97281"/>CD40 signaling cascade<Node id="97303"/> , like TNF-alpha and EBV.
9285527:Our results support the idea that human CD36 mediates <Node id="97392"/>signal transduction<Node id="97411"/> events in response to Ox LDL.

9857074:The serine protease granzyme B is an essential component of the <Node id="97754"/>granule exocytosis pathway<Node id="97780"/> , a major apoptotic mechanism used by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells to induce target cell <Node id="97890"/>apoptosis<Node id="97899"/>.
9834055:BASH shows a substantial sequence similarity to SLP-76, an adaptor protein functioning in <Node id="97999"/>TCR-signal transduction<Node id="98022"/> .
9834055:These findings suggest that BASH is involved in <Node id="98081"/>BCR-mediated signal transduction<Node id="98113"/> and could play a critical role in B cell development in the bursa.
9823774:<Node id="98189"/>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) signaling<Node id="98244"/> involves activation of STATs, proteins that serve the dual function of <Node id="98316"/>signal transduction<Node id="98335"/> and activation of <Node id="98354"/>transcription<Node id="98367"/>.
9840924:Tpl-2 induces IL-2 expression in T-cell lines by triggering multiple signaling pathways that activate NFAT and NF-kappaB.
9840924:Here we show that the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 is inhibited by mutant signaling molecules that inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or the <Node id="98677"/>calcineurin/NFAT pathways<Node id="98702"/> and is promoted by combinations of signaling molecules that activate these pathways.
9840924:We, therefore, conclude that signals generated by the convergence of the MAPK and the <Node id="98882"/>calcineurin/NFAT pathway<Node id="98906"/> are necessary and sufficient for the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2.
9831865:The <Node id="98998"/>JAK/STAT pathway<Node id="99014"/> is one of the signaling pathways implicated in mediating biological responses induced by these cytokines.
9831170:Upon ligand-induced Mpl homodimerization, the major signaling events for proliferation are mediated through the <Node id="99241"/>JAK2/STAT5 pathway<Node id="99259"/> , while differentiation might occur through a prolonged activation of the <Node id="99334"/>MAPK pathway<Node id="99346"/> .
9846495:GATA-3 inhibits Th1 cytokines by a cell-intrinsic mechanism that is not dependent on IL-4 and that may involve repression of <Node id="99482"/>IL-12 signaling<Node id="99497"/> .
9846495:Thus, GATA-3 expression and <Node id="99536"/>IL-12 signaling<Node id="99551"/> are mutually antagonistic, which facilitates rapid dominance of one pathway during early Th development, producing a stable divergence in cytokine profiles.
9862673:Flow cytometric and morphological analyses demonstrated that the addition of CD70 transfectants to B cell cultures remarkably promoted differentiation into plasma cells in the presence of <Node id="99905"/>IL-4 and CD40 signaling<Node id="99928"/> .
9862673:Taken together, our findings indicate that signaling via CD27 on B cells induces IgE synthesis, in cooperation with <Node id="100055"/>IL-4 and CD40 signaling<Node id="100078"/>, by promoting the generation of plasma cells through up-regulation of positive regulatory domain I-binding factor-1.
9817603:In addition, <Node id="100217"/>Ras(G12V) complemented signaling<Node id="100249"/> by an erythropoietin receptor mutant defective in Ras activation and augmented the activation of the beta-casein promoter by the <Node id="100379"/>mutant erythropoietin receptor signaling<Node id="100419"/> , suggesting a possible role of Ras in Stat5-mediated <Node id="100474"/>gene expression<Node id="100489"/>.
9817603:These results collectively reveal a complex interaction of STAT5 with other signaling pathways and illustrate that regulation of <Node id="100628"/>gene expression<Node id="100643"/> requires integration of opposing signals
9794375:We have examined changes in HS1 phosphorylation after differential stimulation of CD3, CD2, and CD28 to elucidate its role in T cells and to further delineate the signaling pathways recruited by these receptors.
9765295:We have investigated the signal transduction pathway from Fc receptors that leads to gene activation and production of cytokines in monocytes.
9765295:These results strongly suggest that the signaling pathway from Fc receptors leading to expression of different genes important to leukocyte biology, initiates with tyrosine kinases and requires MAPK activation; but in contrast to other tyrosine kinase receptors, FcR-mediated MAPK activation does not involve Ras and Raf.
9742120:The ability of E2A-HLF to prolong the survival of interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine pro-B cells after IL-3 withdrawal suggests that it disrupts signaling pathways normally responsible for cell suicide, allowing the cells to accumulate as transformed lymphoblasts.
9730957:These results suggest that 1) lipid A myristoyl <Node id="101718"/>fatty acid<Node id="101728"/>, although it is important for the induction of inflammatory cytokine production by human monocytes, is not necessary for the induction of Mn SOD, 2) endotoxin-mediated induction of Mn SOD and inflammatory cytokines are regulated, at least in part, through different signal transduction pathways , and 3) failure of the mutant endotoxin to induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha production is, at least in part, due to its inability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase.
9802971:A nongenomic mechanism for progesterone-mediated immunosuppression: inhibition of <Node id="102293"/>K+ channels, Ca2+ signaling<Node id="102320"/> , and <Node id="102327"/>gene expression<Node id="102342"/> in T lymphocytes.
9802971:As a result, <Node id="102382"/>Ca2+ signaling<Node id="102396"/> and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT)-driven <Node id="102452"/>gene expression<Node id="102467"/> are inhibited.
9802971:Progesterone acts distally to the initial steps of <Node id="102542"/>T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signal transduction<Node id="102592"/> , since it blocks sustained Ca2+ signals after thapsigargin stimulation, as well as oscillatory Ca2+ signals, but not the Ca2+ transient after TCR stimulation.
9743370:Additional stimulation of the <Node id="102791"/>CD3/TCR pathway<Node id="102806"/> enhances the oxidative and apoptotic effects.
9800475:We propose that one of the targets of PGE2, whose effect distinguishes Th1 from Th2, resides in the downstream <Node id="102972"/>PKC/Ras-mediated pathway<Node id="102996"/> .

9783909:Down-regulation of 17beta-HSD IV mRNA expression was associated with enhanced estradiol inactivation by U937 cells, suggesting a link between <Node id="103339"/>estrogenic pathways<Node id="103358"/> and cell proliferation.
9765256:In this study, we present evidence indicating that signal transduction pathways induced by PGE2 necessitate the participation of cyclic AMP, protein kinase A, and Ca2+.
9741337:Our results suggest that reduced IL-2 production by neonatal T cells is specific for anti-CD3 and anti-CD3+ anti-CD28-mediated stimulation and that these activators cannot effectively activate the <Node id="103765"/>ROI-NF-kappa B signalling pathway<Node id="103798"/> in neonatal T cells.
9728057:Hemorrhagic shock (HS) initiates an <Node id="103864"/>inflammatory cascade<Node id="103884"/> that includes the production of cytokines and recruitment of neutrophils (PMN) and may progress to organ failure, inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

9727049:A <Node id="104564"/>p56lck-independent pathway of CD2 signaling<Node id="104607"/> involves Jun kinase.
9727049:We now provide evidence for a <Node id="104667"/>CD2-based signaling pathway<Node id="104694"/> which, in contrast to that of the T cell receptor, is independent of p56.
9727049:These data elucidate differences between <Node id="104818"/>TCR and CD2 signaling pathways<Node id="104848"/> in the same T cells.
9796702:Activation of this lipid kinase is able to induce <Node id="104928"/>critical Rac-1 signaling pathways<Node id="104961"/> and can couple p21ras to cell survival mechanisms via the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB.
9796702:The role of PtdIns 3-kinase in <Node id="105092"/>Ras signaling<Node id="105105"/> in T cells has not been explored.
9796702:In the present study, we examined the ability of PtdIns 3-kinase to initiate the <Node id="105229"/>Rac-1 signaling pathways<Node id="105253"/> important for T cell activation.
9796702:Ras can initiate <Node id="105312"/>Rac-1 regulated signaling pathways<Node id="105346"/> in the context of T cell antigen receptor function independently of PtdIns 3-kinase activity.
9712047:We have found recently that okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases are involved in a <Node id="105539"/>cyclosporin A-insensitive pathway<Node id="105572"/> that selectively transmits costimulatory signals.
9791541:Specific families of receptors, kinases, transcription factors, and cysteine proteases, termed caspases, are involved in the <Node id="105756"/>apoptotic cascade<Node id="105773"/> leading to proteolysis of specific substrates and to morphological changes associated with <Node id="105865"/>programmed cell death<Node id="105886"/>.
9791541:Although common members of the <Node id="105927"/>apoptotic cascade<Node id="105944"/> are shared between different cell types, it appears that cell-specific factors can influence the response to a given apoptotic stimuli.
9791541:Characterization and understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in the different pathways protecting or leading to cell death may provide novel ways to control inappropriate <Node id="106267"/>apoptosis<Node id="106276"/> involved in several diseases.
9733846:We have pursued our investigation of the role of the <Node id="106368"/>CD4 transduction pathway<Node id="106392"/> in HIV-induced <Node id="106408"/>apoptosis<Node id="106417"/>.
9733846:These observations demonstrate that <Node id="106463"/>CD4 signaling<Node id="106476"/> mediates HIV-induced <Node id="106498"/>apoptosis<Node id="106507"/> by a mechanism independent of Fas-Fas ligand interaction, does not require <Node id="106583"/>p56(lck) signaling<Node id="106601"/> , and may involve a critical region for CD4 dimerization.
9712026:A <Node id="106670"/>CD28-associated signaling pathway<Node id="106703"/> leading to cytokine gene <Node id="106729"/>transcription<Node id="106742"/> and T cell proliferation without TCR engagement.
9712026:To test whether this putative function of CD28 is mediated via a particular signaling pathway, we compared early signaling events initiated in resting T cells by the stimulatory mAb BW 828 with signals triggered by the nonstimulating CD28 mAb 9.3.
9712026:In contrast to the differential signaling of BW 828 and 9.3 in resting T cells, the two mAbs exhibited a similar pattern of early signaling events in activated T cells and Jurkat cells (p56(lck) activation, association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with CD28), indicating that the signaling capacity of CD28 changes with activation.
9712026:These data support the view that stimulation through CD28 can induce some effector functions in T cells and suggest that this capacity is associated with a particular pattern of early signaling events
9794422:Consistent with defective transport along the <Node id="107655"/>endocytic pathway<Node id="107672"/> , the maturation of SDS-stable class II alphabeta dimers--dependent upon removal of Ii chain and peptide loading of class II dimers in the MHC class II compartment--was markedly impaired in M. tuberculosis-infected cells.
9768594:Analysis of <Node id="107915"/>cytokine signaling<Node id="107933"/> in patients with extrinsic asthma and hyperimmunoglobulin E.
9768594:Examination of Stat6 DNA-binding activity demonstrated no activation of <Node id="108075"/>IL-4 signaling<Node id="108089"/> in patients with either HIE or acute asthma.
9712019:These data indicate that the IFN-gamma-independent component of the target cell HLA-DR expression induced by lymphocyte adhesion uses a signaling pathway that is distinct from the IFN-gamma-dependent mechanism and also suggest that CIITA is not required.
9808178:The association and activation of the IL-1 receptor-associated protein kinase (IRAK) to the IL-1 receptor complex is one of the earliest events detectable in <Node id="108564"/>IL-1 signal transduction<Node id="108588"/> .
9808178:We generated permanent clones of the murine T cell line EL4 6.1 overexpressing human (h)IRAK to evaluate the role of this kinase in <Node id="108731"/>IL-1 signaling<Node id="108745"/> .
9794414:The role of <Node id="108768"/>protein kinase C signaling<Node id="108794"/> in activated DRA <Node id="108812"/>transcription<Node id="108825"/>.
9756643:This study shows that the <Node id="108861"/>mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade<Node id="108901"/> is blocked when anergy is induced to high concentrations of soluble peptide.
9710600:However, plasma membrane-proximal elements in these <Node id="109039"/>proinflammatory cytokine pathways<Node id="109072"/> are apparently not involved since dominant negative mutants of the TRAF2 and TRAF6 adaptors, which effectively block signaling through the cytoplasmic tails of the TNF-alpha and IL-1 receptors, respectively, do not inhibit Tax induction of NF-kappaB.
9710600:Together, these studies demonstrate that HTLV-1 Tax exploits a distal part of the <Node id="109414"/>proinflammatory cytokine signaling cascade<Node id="109456"/> leading to induction of NF-kappaB.
9804806:Role of IKK1 and IKK2 in <Node id="109525"/>lipopolysaccharide signaling<Node id="109553"/> in human monocytic cells.
9804806:Recently, we have reported that the <Node id="109624"/>tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1 signaling pathways<Node id="109682"/> activate two kinases, IKK1 and IKK2.
9794389:IL-7 reconstitutes multiple aspects of <Node id="109767"/>v-Abl-mediated signaling<Node id="109791"/> .
9794389:Previous studies have shown constitutive activation of <Node id="109857"/>IL-4 and IL-7 signaling pathways<Node id="109889"/> , as measured by activation of Janus protein kinase (JAK)1, JAK3, STAT5, and STAT6, in pre-B cells transformed by v-Abl.
9794389:These results identify a potential role for <Node id="110063"/>IL-7 signaling pathways<Node id="110086"/> in transformation by v-Abl while demonstrating that a combination of <Node id="110156"/>IL-4 and IL-7 signaling<Node id="110179"/> cannot substitute for an active v-Abl kinase in transformed pre-B cells.
9787185:Coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO) catalyzes the sixth step of the <Node id="110326"/>heme biosynthetic pathway<Node id="110351"/> .
9710582:The effect of Rho on AP-1 is independent of the <Node id="110410"/>mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway<Node id="110450"/> , as a dominant-negative MEK and a MEK inhibitor (PD98059) did not affect Rho-induced AP-1 activity.
9700101:One consequence of the activation of PKC can be increased expression of <Node id="110632"/>mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways<Node id="110679"/> .
9665884:SLP-76 was not required for TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of most proteins, but was required for optimal tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1), as well as <Node id="110893"/>Ras pathway<Node id="110904"/> activation .
9665884:Thus, coupling of TCR-regulated PTKs to downstream signaling pathways requires SLP-76.
9649341:This suggested that Ro 09-2210 was inhibiting an activator of AP-1 which was upstream of c-jun and downstream of <Node id="111134"/>ras signaling<Node id="111147"/> .
9572990:In conclusion, our data suggest the involvement of the <Node id="111213"/>Jak/Stat signal pathway<Node id="111236"/> in MHC-I-induced <Node id="111254"/>signal transduction<Node id="111273"/> in T cells.
9710149:This inhibition is not accompanied by a loss in viability, and DMDTC-treated T cells retain other active signaling pathways throughout the exposure duration.
9690455:To determine whether the acquisition of antitumor function during ex vivo activation is associated with modifications in <Node id="111581"/>signal transduction<Node id="111600"/> capacity , the protein tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn and proteins of the NF-kappaB family were analyzed in tumor-draining LN T cells.

9649186:Effects of <Node id="111910"/>oxidative stress<Node id="111926"/> on stimulation-dependent <Node id="111952"/>signal transduction<Node id="111971"/> , leading to IL-2 expression, were studied.
9697844:MyD88, originally isolated as a myeloid differentiation primary response gene, is shown to act as an adaptor in <Node id="112136"/>interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling<Node id="112166"/> by interacting with both the IL-1 receptor complex and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK).
9697844:Taken together, these results demonstrate that MyD88 is a critical component in the signaling cascade that is mediated by IL-1 receptor as well as IL-18 receptor.
9678718:Using this RAR-selective antagonist, and RXR and RAR agonist, we demonstrate the <Node id="112522"/>RAR-mediated signaling pathway<Node id="112552"/> is important for differentiation and <Node id="112590"/>apoptosis<Node id="112599"/> of myeloid leukemic cells.

8392437:Altogether, the data provide the evidence that both pathways complement each other in regulating <Node id="117987"/>gene expression<Node id="118002"/> and, conversely, downregulate the <Node id="118037"/>TcR transduction<Node id="118053"/> mechanisms .

1712226:Taken together, the results indicate that M-CSF treatment is associated with differential activation of multiple members of the jun/fos family and that expression of these genes could contribute to nuclear signaling mechanisms that regulate a specific program of monocyte differentiation.
1719551:These results demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of an AP-1-related protein is regulated by the <Node id="122295"/>cAMP-dependent second-messenger pathway<Node id="122334"/> and suggest that JunD and other AP-1-related proteins may play an important role in the regulation of <Node id="122437"/>gene expression<Node id="122452"/> by <Node id="122456"/>cAMP-dependent intracellular signaling pathways<Node id="122503"/> .

2192264:Involvement of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in the signal transduction pathway for interleukin-1.
2192264:This inhibitor did not affect protein kinase C-mediated gene <Node id="123091"/>transcription<Node id="123104"/>, suggesting that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases are involved in the signal transduction pathway for IL-1 in a number of responsive cell types.
2196387:This suggests a model in which functionally indistinguishable kappa B complexes can be activated via two separate pathways of <Node id="123388"/>signal transduction<Node id="123407"/> distinguishable by CsA.
2109187:Based on these results, we propose that NTF and OTF2 interactions (both with their cognate DNA elements and possibly at the protein-protein level) may be critical to B-cell-specific expression and that these interactions provide additional pathways for regulating <Node id="123704"/>gene expression<Node id="123719"/>.
2123553:Two distinct signal transmission pathways in T lymphocytes are inhibited by complexes formed between an immunophilin and either FK506 or rapamycin.
1972889:While the HIV-2 and HIV-1 tat genes and T-cell activators apparently employ independent modes of action, the CMV transactivator in combination with the HIV-2 tat or T-cell activators may employ a gene activation pathway with some common and some distinct components.
1670606:In an analysis of the molecular mechanism by which IL-2 message was generated, we showed that a fibronectin-VLA-5 fibronectin receptor interaction may contribute an independent signal distinct from the <Node id="124362"/>CD3 pathway<Node id="124373"/> of activation by the induction of an AP-1 transcriptional factor.
1670606:Thus the VLA-5 fibronectin receptor on CD4 cells can play a complementary role in <Node id="124530"/>CD3-TCR-mediated signal transduction<Node id="124566"/> through its interaction with fibronectin.
1964088:Consequently, one function of Tax in cells infected with HTLV-I might involve cell-type-specific suppression, as opposed to activation, of distinct signal pathways .
1702384:However, cyclosporin A and FK506 did not inhibit Ca2+ mobilization dependent expression of c-fos mRNA indicating that only a subset of signalling pathways regulated by Ca2+ is sensitive to these drugs.

7479924:In conclusion, our data suggest that SE can modulate IL-2R expression and <Node id="125581"/>signal transduction<Node id="125600"/> involving the <Node id="125615"/>Jak/Stat pathway<Node id="125631"/> in CD4+ T-cell lines.
7489741:Moreover, the induction of both Jak 1 and 3, and STAT 5 activity strongly correlated with the growth-promoting effects of IL-7, suggesting that this <Node id="125811"/>signal transduction<Node id="125830"/> mechanism may play a key role in IL-7-induced proliferation.
8707445:It has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activity in a variety of animal models and more recently to inhibit <Node id="126015"/>IL-2 induced signal transduction<Node id="126047"/> .
7637809:An <Node id="126061"/>IRF-1-dependent pathway<Node id="126084"/> of DNA damage-induced <Node id="126107"/>apoptosis<Node id="126116"/> in mitogen-activated T lymphocytes.
7637809:The tumour suppressor p53 has been shown to regulate this type of <Node id="126227"/>apoptosis<Node id="126236"/> in thymocytes, but an as yet unknown, <Node id="126275"/>p53-independent pathway<Node id="126298"/> (s) appears to mediate the same event in mitogen-activated mature T lymphocytes.
7637809:Thus two different anti-onco-genic <Node id="126423"/>transcription<Node id="126436"/> factors, p53 and IRF-1, are required for distinct <Node id="126487"/>apoptotic pathways<Node id="126505"/> in T lymphocytes.
8566023:Activation through the <Node id="126555"/>Ca2+/calcineurin pathway<Node id="126579"/> is essential to the <Node id="126600"/>transcription<Node id="126613"/> of many cytokine genes.
8580378:A number of cytokines and growth factors use the <Node id="126695"/>JAK-STAT pathway<Node id="126711"/> to signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus.
8580378:We therefore propose that <Node id="126795"/>IL-2 receptor signal transduction<Node id="126828"/> does not depend on equimolar heterodimerization of JAK1 and JAK3 following IL-2-induced heterodimerization of IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma.
7481768:The lack of Jak3 expression correlated with impaired <Node id="127028"/>B cell signaling<Node id="127044"/> , as demonstrated by the inability of IL-4 to activate Stat6 in the EBV-transformed cell line from the patient. These observations indicate that the functions of gamma c are dependent on Jak3 and that Jak3 is essential for lymphoid development and signaling.
7588326:PRL and IL-2 receptor activation are both linked to the <Node id="127368"/>Jak/Stat (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway<Node id="127435"/> .
7486667:We are currently engaged in defining where the two signals integrate along the <Node id="127525"/>AP-1/NF-kappa B pathway<Node id="127548"/> .
7591091:These findings indicate that infection of human mononuclear phagocytes with L. donovani leads to impaired gamma interferon-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and selective effects on the <Node id="127745"/>Jak-Stat1 pathway<Node id="127762"/> .
7594468:While <Node id="127779"/>PKC-dependent pathways<Node id="127801"/> sequentially result in the phosphorylation and in an incomplete degradation of IkB alpha in T cell lines, co-activation of <Node id="127925"/>Ca(2+)-dependent pathways<Node id="127950"/> accelerates the rate of IkB alpha phosphorylation and results in its complete degradation.
7594468:Activation of <Node id="128064"/>Ca(2+)-dependent pathways<Node id="128089"/> alone do not result in the phosphorylation and/or degradation of IkB alpha in Jurkat T or in U937 cells.
7594468:Treatment of T cells with the selective PKC inhibitor GF109203X abrogates the PMA-induced IkB alpha phosphorylation/degradation irrespective of activation of <Node id="128361"/>Ca(2+)-dependent pathways<Node id="128386"/> , but not the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB alpha induced by TNF-alpha, a PKC-independent stimulus.
7594468:Contrary to the interaction with <Node id="128537"/>PKC, Ca(2+)-dependent pathways<Node id="128567"/> synergize with TNF-alpha not at the level of IkB alpha phosphorylation, but at the level of its degradation.
7594468:These results indicate that <Node id="128713"/>Ca(2+)-dependent pathways<Node id="128738"/> , including the phosphatase calcineurin, participate in the regulation of NF-kappa B in a cell specific fashion and synergize with <Node id="128870"/>PKC-dependent and -independent pathways<Node id="128909"/> at the level of IkB alpha phosphorylation and degradation.
7640301:We previously have demonstrated a requirement for oxidative events during <Node id="129051"/>cell cycle<Node id="129061"/> entry in T lymphocytes and have hypothesised that reactive oxygen species may act as intracellular signalling agents during lymphocyte activation.
7640301:In the current study, cysteamine, an aminothiol compound with antioxidant activity, has been used to further investigate the role of <Node id="129350"/>oxidative signalling<Node id="129370"/> during lymphocyte activation.
7640301:It therefore was of interest to establish which, if any, commitment events were affected by <Node id="129501"/>oxidative signalling<Node id="129521"/> during <Node id="129529"/>cell cycle<Node id="129539"/> entry.
7640301:Interestingly, Oct1 and NF-AT DNA binding activity were not affected by cysteamine treatment, suggesting that <Node id="129665"/>oxidative signalling<Node id="129685"/> processes operate in a selective manner.
7640301:The identification of regulatory proteins, such as <Node id="129786"/>transcription<Node id="129799"/> factors, as molecular targets for oxidative signalling provides further evidence to implicate oxidative signalling as being intimately involved in the G0 to <Node id="129957"/>G1 phase<Node id="129965"/> transition in T lymphocytes.

10409763: A site in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforming protein LMP1 that constitutively associates with the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated death domain protein TRADD to mediate NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation is critical for long-term lymphoblastoid cell proliferation. We now find that <Node id="130567"/>LMP1 signaling<Node id="130581"/> through TRADD differs from <Node id="130609"/>TNFR1 signaling<Node id="130624"/> through TRADD. LMP1 needs only 11 amino acids to activate NF-kappaB or synergize with TRADD in NF-kappaB activation, while TNFR1 requires approximately 70 residues. Further, LMP1 does not require TRADD residues 294 to 312 for NF-kappaB activation, while TNFR1 requires TRADD residues 296 to 302. LMP1 is partially blocked for NF-kappaB activation by a TRADD mutant consisting of residues 122 to 293. Unlike TNFR1, LMP1 can interact directly with receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and stably associates with RIP in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. Surprisingly, LMP1 does not require RIP for NF-kappaB activation. Despite constitutive association with TRADD or RIP, LMP1 does not induce <Node id="131322"/>apoptosis<Node id="131331"/> in EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma or human embryonic kidney 293 cells. These results add a different perspective to the molecular interactions through which LMP1, TRADD, and RIP participate in B-lymphocyte activation and growth.
9616163: The translocation t(10;11)(p13;q14) has been observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A recent study showed a MLL/AF10 fusion in all cases of AML with t(10;11) and various breakpoints on chromosome 11 ranging from q13 to q23. We recently cloned CALM (Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid leukemia gene), the fusion partner of AF10 at 11q14 in the monocytic cell line U937. To further define the role of these genes in acute leukemias, 10 cases (9 AML and 1 ALL) with cytogenetically proven t(10;11)(p12-14;q13-21) and well-characterized morphology, immunophenotype, and clinical course were analyzed. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed with 2 YACs flanking the CALM region, a YAC contig of the MLL region, and a YAC spanning the AF10 breakpoint. Rearrangement of at least one of these genes was detected in all cases with balanced t(10;11). In 4 cases, including 3 AML with immature morphology (1 AML-M0 and 2 AML-M1) and 1 ALL, the signals of the CALM YACS were separated in interphase cells, indicating a translocation breakpoint within the CALM region. MLL was rearranged in 3 AML with myelomonocytic differentiation (2 AML-M2 and 1 AML-M5), including 1 secondary AML. In all 3 cases, a characteristic immunophenotype was identified (CD4+, CD13-, CD33+, CD65s+). AF-10 was involved in 5 of 6 evaluable cases, including 1 case without detectable CALM or MLL rearrangement. In 2 complex translocations, none of the three genes was rearranged. All cases had a remarkably poor prognosis, with a mean survival of 9.6 +/- 6.6 months. For the 7 AML cases that were uniformly treated according to the AMLCG86/92 protocols, disease-free and overall survival was significantly worse than for the overall study group (P = .03 and P = .01, respectively). We conclude that the t(10;11)(p13;q14) indicates CALM and MLL rearrangements in morphologically distinct subsets of acute leukemia and may be associated with a poor prognosis.
8683110: Sublethal levels of <Node id="133597"/>oxidative stress<Node id="133613"/> are well known to alter T cell functional responses, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The current study examined the effects of <Node id="133752"/>oxidative stress<Node id="133768"/> on transcriptional activities mediated by c-Fos/c-Jun AP-1 and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). The present results show that Jurkat T cells acutely exposed to micromolar concentrations of H2O2 exhibit substantial increases in AP-1 binding activity and the expression of c-jun but not c-fos mRNA. The preferential induction of c-jun by H2O2 did not represent redox stabilization of mRNA transcripts, and oxidative signals closely resembled PHA/PMA stimulation by effectively transactivating the full length c-jun promoter via the proximal jun1 tumor promoter-responsive element (TRE)-like promoter element. Similarly, the complexes binding the consensus AP-1 TRE and jun TRE-like motifs in cells exposed to oxidative signals or PHA/PMA were indistinguishable, being composed of c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunD. However, PHA/PMA but not oxidative signals induced the coordinate activation of reporter constructs containing the AP-1-TRE, NF-AT, and IL-2 promoter regions along with IL-2 mRNA expression. Furthermore, sublethal levels of H2O2 actively suppressed the transcriptional activation of NF-AT and IL-2 reporters as well as the expression of IL-2 mRNA in cells stimulated with PHA/PMA. Gel shift analysis revealed that oxidative suppression of NF-AT represented inhibition in the early generation of NFAT complexes rather than the binding of preformed NF-AT complexes. These results suggest that oxidative signals can positively and negatively regulate T cell transcriptional events and that changes in cellular redox can uncouple AP-1 regulation of c-jun from transcriptional up-regulation of IL-2 via NF-AT.
1652603: Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor binding parameters were studied in 15 severely depressed patients during depression and after clinical recovery, and in 15 healthy controls. There was no difference in glucocorticoid receptor number or affinity between depressed patients and recovered or control subjects. Afternoon ACTH and cortisol concentrations did not differ significantly between the three groups. No relationship could be established between glucocorticoid receptor binding and antidepressant medication. These data support the view of an impaired ligand-induced plasticity of glucocorticoid receptor regulation rather than the hypothesis of decreased glucocorticoid receptor numbers during depression.
9427533: The human autosomal recessive disease, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), can result from mutations in any one of seven genes, designated XPA through XPG. Of these, the XPB and XPD genes encode proteins that are subunits of a general transcription factor, TFIIH, involved in both <Node id="136395"/>nucleotide excision repair<Node id="136421"/> (NER) and initiation of mRNA <Node id="136451"/>transcription by RNA polymerase II<Node id="136485"/>. In humans, mutation of the XPB or XPD gene impairs NER, resulting in hyper-sensitivity to sunlight and greatly increased skin tumor formation. However, no <Node id="136642"/>transcription<Node id="136655"/> deficiency has been demonstrated in either XP-B or XP-D. We have employed an optimized cell-free RNA <Node id="136757"/>transcription<Node id="136770"/> assay to analyze <Node id="136788"/>transcription<Node id="136801"/> activity of XP-B and XP-D. Although the growth rate was normal, the XP-B and XP-D cells contained reduced amounts of TFIIH. Extracts prepared from XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells exhibited similar <Node id="137002"/>transcription<Node id="137015"/> activity from the adenovirus major late promoter when compared to that in extracts from normal cells. Thus, we conclude that the XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells do not have impaired RNA <Node id="137205"/>transcription<Node id="137218"/> activity. We consider the possible consequences of the reduced cellular content of TFIIH for the clinical symptoms in XP-B or XP-D patients, and discuss a 'conditional phenotype' that may involve an impairment of cellular function only under certain growth conditions.
9442388: In order to elucidate the role of NF-ATp, one of the most prominent members of family of NF-AT transcription factors in peripheral T lymphocytes, in T cell activation and differentiation we created NF-ATp-deficient mice by gene targeting. Such NF-ATp-/- mice are born and appear to develop a normal immune system. Apart from clear-cut defects in the synthesis of mRNAs for Th2-type lymphokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13, in primary and secondary stimulations of spleen cells in vitro, of a distinct impaired deletion of V beta 11+/CD4+ T lymphocytes from these mice was detected after superantigen injection. Moreover, NF-ATp-/- mice older than 6 weeks show an 2-5 fold increase in number of lymphocytes. This is correlated with an increased expression of activation markers CD44 and CD69 and decreased expression of CD62.
10330189: In response to activation of the <Node id="138374"/>Wnt signaling pathway<Node id="138395"/>, beta-catenin accumulates in the nucleus, where it cooperates with LEF/TCF (for lymphoid enhancer factor and T-cell factor) transcription factors to activate <Node id="138554"/>gene expression<Node id="138569"/>. The mechanisms by which beta-catenin undergoes this shift in location and participates in activation of gene <Node id="138680"/>transcription<Node id="138693"/> are unknown. We demonstrate here that beta-catenin can be imported into the nucleus independently of LEF/TCF binding, and it may also be exported from nuclei. We have introduced a small deletion within beta-catenin (Delta19) that disrupts binding to LEF-1, E-cadherin, and APC but not axin. This Delta19 beta-catenin mutant localizes to the nucleus because it may not be efficiently sequestered in the cytoplasm. The nuclear localization of Delta19 definitively demonstrates that the mechanisms by which beta-catenin localizes in the nucleus are completely independent of LEF/TCF factors. beta-Catenin and LEF-1 complexes can activate reporter <Node id="139338"/>gene expression<Node id="139353"/> in a transformed T-lymphocyte cell line (Jurkat) but not in normal T lymphocytes, even though both factors are nuclear. Thus, localization of both factors to the nucleus is not sufficient for activation of <Node id="139560"/>gene expression<Node id="139575"/>. Excess beta-catenin can squelch reporter gene activation by LEF-1-beta-catenin complexes but not activation by the transcription factor VP16. Taken together, these data suggest that a third component is necessary for gene activation and that this third component may vary with cell type.
8392092: We have previously shown that minimally oxidized LDL (MM-LDL) activated endothelial cells to increase their interaction with monocytes but not neutrophils, inducing monocyte but not neutrophil binding and synthesis of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and monocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). In the present studies we have examined the signaling pathways by which this monocyte-specific response is induced. Both induction of monocyte binding and mRNA levels for M-CSF by MM-LDL were not inhibited in protein kinase C-depleted endothelial cells. A number of our studies indicate that cAMP is the second messenger for the effects of MM-LDL cited above. Incubation of endothelial cells with MM-LDL caused a 173% increase in intracellular cAMP levels. Agents which increased cAMP levels, including cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, dibutyryl cAMP, and isoproterenol mimicked the actions of MM-LDL. Agents which elevated cAMP were also shown to activate NF kappa B, suggesting a role for this transcription factor in activation of monocyte-endothelial interactions. Although endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM) mRNA synthesis can be regulated by NF kappa B, ELAM was not expressed and ELAM mRNA was only slightly elevated in response to MM-LDL. We present evidence that induction of neutrophil binding by LPS is actually suppressed by agents that elevated cAMP levels.
1431113: We have tested the hypothesis that cellular activation events occurring in T lymphocytes and monocytes and mediated through translocation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B are dependent upon the constitutive redox status of these cells. We used phenolic, lipid-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidants (butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), nordihydroquairetic acid, or alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) to show that peroxyl radical scavenging in unstimulated and PMA- or TNF-stimulated cells blocks the functions depending on NF-kappa B activation. BHA was found to suppress not only PMA- or TNF-induced, but also constitutive, HIV-enhancer activity concomitant to an inhibition of NF-kappa B binding activity in both lymphoblastoid T (J.Jhan) and monocytic (U937) cell lines. This was also true for KBF (p50 homodimer) binding activity in U937 cells. Secretion of TNF, the product of another NF-kappa B-dependent gene, was abolished by BHA in PMA-stimulated U937 cells. The anti-oxidative effect of BHA was accompanied by an increase in thiol, but not glutathione, content in stimulated and unstimulated T cell, whereas TNF stimulation itself barely modified the cellular thiol level. <Node id="142439"/>Oxidative stress<Node id="142455"/> obtained by the addition of H2O2 to the culture medium of J.Jhan or U937 cells could not by itself induce NF-kappa B activation. These observations suggest that TNF and PMA do not lead to NF-kappa B activation through induction of changes in the cell redox status. Rather, TNF and PMA can exert their effect only if cells are in an appropriate redox status, because prior modification toward reduction with BHA treatment prevents this activation. It appears that a basal redox equilibrium tending toward oxidation is a prerequisite for full activation of transduction pathways regulating the activity of NF-kappa B-dependent genes.
8901569: Globin genes are subject to tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific regulation. A switch from human fetal (gamma)-to adult (beta)-globin expression occurs within erythroid precursor cells of the adult lineage. Previously we and others showed by targeted gene disruption that the zinc finger gene, erythroid Kr&#x95bf;&#x71b8;&#x67bb;&#x93b7;&#x7a5a;pel-like factor (EKLF), is required for expression of the beta-globin gene in mice, presumably through interaction with a high-affinity binding site in the proximal promoter. To examine the role of EKLF in the developmental regulation of the human gamma-globin gene we interbred EKLF heterozygotes (+/-) with mice harboring a human beta-globin yeast artificial chromosome transgene. We find that in the absence of EKLF, while human beta-globin expression is dramatically reduced, gamma-globin transcripts are elevated approximately 5-fold. Impaired silencing of gamma-globin expression identifies EKLF as the first transcription factor participating quantitatively in the gamma-globin to beta-globin switch. Our findings are compatible with a competitive model of switching in which EKLF mediates an adult stage-specific interaction between the beta-globin gene promoter and the locus control region that excludes the gamma-globin gene.
9247567: The transcription factor NF-kappa B controls the induction of numerous cytokine promoters during the activation of T lymphocytes. Inhibition of T cell activation by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 exerts a suppressive effect on the induction of these NF-kappa B-controlled cytokine promoters. We show for human Jurkat T leukemia cells, as well as human and mouse primary T lymphocytes, that this inhibitory effect is accompanied by an impaired nuclear translocation of the Rel proteins c-Rel, RelA/p65 and NF-kappa B1/p50, whereas the nuclear appearance of RelB remains unaffected. CsA does not interfere with the synthesis of Rel proteins, but prevents the inducible degradation of cytosolic NF-kappa B inhibitors I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta upon T cell activation. CsA neither inhibits the processing of the NF-kappa B1 precursor p105 to p50, nor does it "stabilize" the C-terminal portion of p105, I kappa B gamma, which is degraded during p105 processing to mature p50. These results indicate that CsA interferes with a specific event in the signal-induced degradation of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta, but does not affect the processing of NF-kappa B1/p105 to p50.
9663467: Thrombopoietin (TPO) acts on megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis in vitro and in vivo. We isolated a novel subline, UT-7/GMT, from the human leukemia cell line UT-7/GM (N. Komatsu, et al., Blood, 89: 4021-4033, 1997). A small population of UT-7/GM cells positively stained for hemoglobin (Hb) after a 7-day exposure to TPO. More than 50% of TPO-treated UT-7/GMT cells positively stained for Hb. Using UT-7/GMT cells, we examined how TPO promotes hemoglobinization. TPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the TPO receptor but not the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor. There was no competition between TPO and EPO for binding to EPO receptor. These findings suggest that TPO has a direct effect on hemoglobinization via a specific receptor on UT-7/GMT cells. Isoelectric focusing demonstrated that TPO induced fetal and adult Hb synthesis, whereas EPO induced embryonic, fetal, and adult Hb synthesis. Thus, our data suggest that TPO has a distinct action on erythropoiesis.
1510878: We have analysed the effect of mitogenic lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels as well as on activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding and enhancer activity in Jurkat T-cells. Both c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels were increased after Con A and PHA stimulation. Since T-cell stimulation increases both intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP levels and activates protein kinase C (PKC), the possible involvement of these intracellular messengers in c-Fos and c-Jun induction was tested. PMA, which directly activates PKC, mimicked the effect of the lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun, but elevation of either intracellular Ca2+ or cAMP levels had little or no effect. The mitogen-induced increase of c-Fos and c-Jun immunoreactivity was inhibited by H-7, a kinase inhibitor with relatively high specificity for PKC, and less efficiently by H-8, a structurally related kinase inhibitor less active on PKC, but more active on cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases. Con A stimulation was found to increase both binding of AP-1 to the AP-1 consensus sequence, TRE, and AP-1 enhancer activity, in Jurkat cells. PMA was also found to increase the AP-1 enhancer activity, whereas elevation of Ca2+ or cAMP had only minor effects. We conclude that stimulation with mitogenic lectins is sufficient to increase both c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels, AP-1 binding and AP-1 enhancer activity in Jurkat cells and that they act via mechanisms that could involve the activation of PKC.
1653950: The transcription factor HIV-TF1, which binds to a region about 60 bp upstream from the enhancer of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), was purified from human B cells. HIV-TF1 had a molecular weight of 39,000. Binding of HIV-TF1 to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) activated <Node id="148295"/>transcription<Node id="148308"/> from the HIV promoter in vitro. The HIV-TF1-binding site in HIV LTR was similar to the site recognized by upstream stimulatory factor (USF) in the adenovirus major late promoter. DNA-binding properties of HIV-TF1 suggested that HIV-TF1 might be identical or related to USF. Interestingly, treatment of purified HIV-TF1 by phosphatase greatly reduced its DNA-binding activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of HIV-TF1 was essential for DNA binding. The disruption of HIV-TF1-binding site induced a 60% decrease in the level of <Node id="148837"/>transcription<Node id="148850"/> from the HIV promoter in vivo. These results suggest that HIV-TF1 is involved in transcriptional regulation of HIV-1.
9794238: In order to understand the role of NF-kappaB in EBV transformation we have established stably transfected IkappaBalpha into lymphoblastoid cells. Two clones were obtained in which the loss of NF-kappaB binding activity correlated with the constitutive expression of the transgenic IkappaBalpha. Protein latency expression was determined by immunocytochemistry. Expression of surface markers, intracytoplasmic content of cytokines <Node id="149408"/>cell cycle<Node id="149418"/> analysis after BrdU incorporation and DNA staining with propidium iodide were studied by flow cytometry. Percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by in-situ labelling of DNA strand breaks. No significative changes in EBV latency nor in cell surface marker expression was found. In contrast, intracytoplasmic TNFalpha levels were strongly reduced in transfected clones. Furthermore, 30% of IkappaBalpha transfected cells were apoptotic after 8 h of TNFalpha treatment. This correlated with a strong reduction of BrdU incorporation after 24 h of TNFalpha treatment. No effect was seen with non transfected cells or with cells transfected with a control plasmid. Our results suggest that the TNFalpha gene could be one of the targets of NF-kappaB in EBV infected cells and that NF-kappaB protects EBV-infected cells from <Node id="150241"/>apoptosis<Node id="150250"/> induced by TNFalpha, which may favour the proliferative effect of this cytokine.
8639461: In humans infected with the HIV-1 virus there may be a disproportionate severity of signs and symptoms of illness compared to the fraction of CD4+ infected T-lymphoid cells. In part, this may be due to altered intercellular signalling systems and intracellular <Node id="150602"/>signal transduction<Node id="150621"/>. Glucocorticoids are well known for their effects on the vitality and function of lymphoid cells. Patients with <Node id="150734"/>HIV infections<Node id="150748"/> often show elevated circulating levels of cortisol, suggesting some misfunction in the regulatory systems that maintain the levels of this critical hormone. At the cellular level, it is known that both acute <Node id="150957"/>HIV infection<Node id="150970"/> and glucocorticoids can cause <Node id="151001"/>apoptotic cell death<Node id="151021"/> in thymic lymphocytes. However, chronically HIV-infected cells appear to be resistant to glucocorticoid-evoked cell death. Glucocorticoid receptor-ligand binding studies on patients' cells have shown reduced affinity between the receptor binding sites and test steroids. In vitro, chronically HIV-infected cells of the lymphoid CEM line displayed resistance to glucocorticoid-induced <Node id="151406"/>apoptosis<Node id="151415"/>. These cells showed reduced numbers of binding sites with little alteration in apparent affinity between ligand and receptor. Thus it appears that there may often be malfunction of the normal glucocorticoid response in HIV-infected cells probably due to altered interactions between the glucocorticoid receptor and its hormone. Such alterations may have clinical consequences, including the possibility of a relatively longer life span of infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes, as well as systemic effects of chronically elevated cortisol level.
9952386: The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, is an important immunoregulatory hormone [1]. Its effects are exerted by interaction with the vitamin D receptor, which is present on human monocytes and activated T and B lymphocytes. Variation in the vitamin D receptor gene was typed in 2015 subjects from large case-control studies of three major infectious diseases: tuberculosis, malaria, and hepatitis B virus. Homozygotes for a polymorphism at codon 352 (genotype tt) were significantly underrepresented among those with tuberculosis (chi2=6.22, 1 df, P=. 01) and persistent hepatitis B infection (chi2=6.25, 1 df, P=.01) but not in subjects with clinical malaria compared with the other genotypes. Therefore, this genetic variant, which predisposes to low bone mineral density in many populations, may confer resistance to certain infectious diseases.
1406939: The candidate oncogene bcl-3 was discovered as a translocation into the immunoglobulin alpha-locus in some cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemias. The protein Bcl-3 contains seven so-called ankyrin repeats. Similar repeat motifs are found in a number of diverse regulatory proteins but the motifs of Bcl-3 are most closely related to those found in I kappa B proteins in which the ankyrin repeat domain is thought to be directly involved in inhibition of NF-kappa B activity. No biological function has yet been described for Bcl-3, but it was noted recently that Bcl-3 interferes with DNA-binding of the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B in vitro. Here we demonstrate that Bcl-3 can aid kappa B site-dependent <Node id="153553"/>transcription<Node id="153566"/> in vivo by counteracting the inhibitory effects of p50/NF-kappa B homodimers. Bcl-3 may therefore aid activation of select NF-kappa B-regulated genes, including those of the human immunodeficiency virus.
1645452: The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], is a potent regulator of human monocyte/macrophage function in vitro. To establish a model for 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of human monocyte monokine synthesis, three human cell lines (U-937, THP-1, and HL-60) were examined for: 1) the presence of functional 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors; 2) the accumulation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA and IL-1 beta protein in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and 3) the regulation of this response by 1,25-(OH)2D3. All three cell lines expressed vitamin D receptor and had increased levels of IL-1 beta mRNA in response to LPS. Preincubation of cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 augmented IL-1 beta mRNA levels only in U-937 and HL-60 cells. From these data, and taking into consideration their state of differentiation and relative ease of culture, U-937 was chosen over HL-60 and THP-1 as the cell line we further characterized. In U-937 cells, optimum time and dose of pretreatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 were determined to be 12-24 h at a receptor saturating concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10 nM). Preincubation of cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 had no effect on the time course of IL-1 beta mRNA appearance in response to LPS. However, exposure of U-937 cells to 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased by 200% the level of IL-1 beta mRNA detected and decreased by three orders of magnitude the concentration of LPS required to achieve steady state mRNA levels equivalent to those observed in U-937 cells not preincubated with the hormone.2+o
7981603: The induction of cell death in lymphoid cells by glucocorticoids is one of the earliest and most thoroughly studied models of <Node id="155443"/>apoptosis<Node id="155452"/>. Although the exact mechanism by which <Node id="155492"/>apoptosis<Node id="155501"/> occurs in lymphocytes is unknown many biochemical and molecular changes have been shown to occur in these cells in response to glucocorticoids. The role of chromatin degradation and endonucleases in the apoptotic process has been closely studied, as well as the involvement of several oncogenes in glucocorticoid-induced cell lysis. In addition, the clinical importance of glucocorticoid-induced <Node id="155898"/>apoptosis<Node id="155907"/> in the treatment of lymphoid neoplasms has recently received increased attention.
9819382: Previously, we have shown that TAL1 and the LIM-only protein gene (LMO) are regularly coactivated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This observation is likely to relate to the findings that TAL1 and LMO are highly synergistic in T-cell tumorigenesis in double-transgenic mice. To understand the molecular mechanisms of functional synergy between TAL1 and LMO in tumorigenesis and transcriptional regulation, we tried to identify downstream target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO by a subtractive PCR method. One of the isolated genes, that for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2), was regularly expressed in most of the T-ALL cell lines that coexpressed TAL1 and LMO. Exogenously transfected TAL1 and LMO, but not either alone, induced RALDH2 expression in a T-ALL cell line, HPB-ALL, not expressing endogeneous TAL1 or LMO. The RALDH2 transcripts in T-ALL were, however, mostly initiated within the second intron. Promoter analysis revealed that a GATA site in a cryptic promoter in the second intron was essential and sufficient for the TAL1- and LMO-dependent transcriptional activation, and GATA3 binds to this site. In addition, forced expression of GATA3 potentiated the induction of RALDH2 by TAL1 and LMO, and these three factors formed a complex in vivo. Furthermore, a TAL1 mutant not binding to DNA also activated the <Node id="157345"/>transcription<Node id="157358"/> of RALDH2 in the presence of LMO and GATA3. Collectively, we have identified the RALDH2 gene as a first example of direct transcriptional target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL. In this case, TAL1 and LMO act as cofactors for GATA3 to activate the <Node id="157616"/>transcription<Node id="157629"/> of RALDH2.
8621390: To study transcriptional regulation in normal human T cells, we have optimized conditions for transient transfection. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter-reporter gene behavior closely parallels the endogenous gene in response to T cell receptor and costimulatory signals. As assessed with mutagenized promoters, the most important IL-2 cis-regulatory elements in normal T cells are the proximal AP-1 site and the NF- kappaB site. Both primary activation, with phytohemagglutinin or antibodies to CD3, and costimulation, provided by pairs of CD2 antibodies or B7-positive (B cells) or B7-negative (endothelial) accessory cells, are mediated through the same cis-elements. Interestingly, the nuclear factor of activated T cell sites are much less important in normal T cells than in Jurkat T cells. We conclude that IL-2 transcriptional regulation differs in tumor cell lines compared with normal T cells and that different costimulatory signals converge on the same cis-elements in the IL-2 promoter.
8387893: The multiple biological activities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are mediated by two distinct cell surface receptors of 55 kd (TNFRp55) and 75 kd (TNFRp75). Using gene targeting, we generated a TNFRp55-deficient mouse strain. Cells from TNFRp55-/-mutant mice lack expression of TNFRp55 but display normal numbers of high affinity TNFRp75 molecules. Thymocyte development and lymphocyte populations are unaltered, and clonal deletion of potentially self-reactive T cells is not impaired. However, <Node id="159151"/>TNF signaling<Node id="159164"/> is largely abolished, as judged by the failure of TNF to induce NF-kappa B in T lymphocytes from TNFRp55-deficient mice. The loss of TNFRp55 function renders mice resistant to lethal dosages of either lipopolysaccharides or S. aureus enterotoxin B. In contrast, TNFRp55-deficient mice are severely impaired to clear L. monocytogenes and readily succumb to infection. Thus, the 55 kd TNFR plays a decisive role in the host's defense against microorganisms and their pathogenic factors.
2011512: The interaction of the Oct2 transcription factor with the cognate octamer motif ATGCAAAT is a critical determinant of the lymphoid-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes. Ectopic expression of cloned Oct2 cDNA was shown to be sufficient to reconstitute at least some aspects of this regulation in non-lymphoid cells. We describe the isolation and characterization of multiple cDNAs encoding mouse Oct2 from a mature B-cell line and we show that a variety of isoforms of this transcription factor is generated from a single gene by an alternative splicing mechanism. All the isoforms retain the previously characterized POU-domain and are therefore able to bind to the octamer motif. Different amounts of the various isoforms are present within the same B-cell regardless of the developmental stage of B-cell differentiation and at least some of the isoforms are conserved between mouse and humans. In cotransfection experiments we show that all the isoforms are able to activate an octamer containing promoter element in fibroblasts revealing an unexpected functional redundancy. Finally, we show that one of the isoforms encodes the previously described lymphoid-specific Oct2B protein which has been suggested to be involved in the function of the octamer motif in the context of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) enhancer.
8977297: To investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in non-monocytic cells, we constructed a series of reporter plasmids with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene linked to various parts of the human IL-1beta promoter and performed transient transfection experiments. We identified a promoter segment that activates <Node id="161374"/>transcription<Node id="161387"/> most efficiently in keratinocytes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with a 43-mer oligonucleotide derived from the functionally identified cis-acting element revealed specific complexes. By competition analysis with transcription factor consensus sequence oligonucleotides and by immunosupershift, transcription factor SP-1 or a closely related protein was shown to bind to this regulatory element. The closest match to the known SP-1 consensus sequence within the respective region is a TCCCCTCCCCT motif. Mutation of this motif almost completely, and specifically, abolished the binding of two low-mobility complexes and led to a 95% decrease of constitutive transcriptional activation of a reporter construct IL-1beta (-170/+108). Likewise, activation of this reporter construct by tumor necrosis factor-alpha depended on the SP-1 site. These observations suggest that a so-far-unrecognized SP-1 site in the human IL-1beta promoter may participate in the transcriptional regulation of this gene in keratinocytes.
10364260: Although many functions of human alveolar macrophages are altered compared with their precursor cell, the blood monocyte (monocyte), the reason(s) for these functional changes have not been determined. We recently reported that human alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity (Monick, M. M., Carter, A. B., Gudmundsson, G., Geist, L. J., and Hunninghake, G. W. (1998) Am. J. Physiol. 275, L389-L397). To determine why alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity, we first showed that there was not a decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN proteins that make up the AP-1 complex. There was, however, a significant difference in the amounts of the nuclear protein, REF-1 (which regulates AP-1 DNA binding by altering the redox status of FOS and JUN proteins), in alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes. In addition, in vitro differentiation of monocytes to a macrophage-like cell resulted in decreased amounts of REF-1. Finally, addition of REF-1 from activated monocytes to alveolar macrophage nuclear proteins resulted in a marked increase in AP-1 DNA binding. These studies strongly suggest that the process of differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages is associated with a loss of REF-1 and AP-1 activity. This observation may explain, in part, some of the functional differences observed for alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes.
9001422: Rhombotin-2 (RBTN-2) is a proto-oncogene only in the context of T lymphocytes. We postulated that the oncogenic effect of RBTN-2 in T cells is likely mediated by binding protein(s) with T cell-specific expression. By screening a T cell cDNA library, we identified a novel ets transcription factor that binds RBTN-2. This protein was named elf-2 because its DNA-binding domain is virtually identical to that of ets family member elf-1. Northern analyses showed similar levels of two elf-2 transcripts (3.5 kb and 3.8 kb) in all tissues except thymus. Thymocytes expressed four- to 10-fold greater amounts of the 3.5 kb transcript than other tissues. Sequence analyses of cDNA clones indicated that these transcripts encode proteins differing only at their amino termini, and likely represent alternatively spliced isoforms. These isoforms (elf-2a and elf-2b) contain identical RBTN-2 binding regions and DNA-binding domains. Elf-2b lacks a putative transactivation domain. The expression patterns suggest that RBTN-2 normally interacts equally with elf-2a and elf-2b. In contrast, when RBTN-2 is inappropriately expressed in T cells, RBTN-2 would interact predominantly with elf-2b; this interaction may lead to T cell proliferation.
7565415: CD4+ macrophages in tissues such as lung, skin, and lymph nodes, promyelocytic cells in bone marrow, and peripheral blood monocytes serve as important targets and reservoirs for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. HIV-1-infected myeloid cells are often diminished in their ability to participate in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and intracellular killing. <Node id="165451"/>HIV-1 infection<Node id="165466"/> of myeloid cells can lead to the expression of surface receptors associated with cellular activation and/or differentiation that increase the responsiveness of these cells to cytokines secreted by neighboring cells as well as to bacteria or other pathogens. Enhancement of HIV-1 replication is related in part to increased DNA-binding activity of cellular transcription factors such as NF-kappa B. NF-kappa B binds to the HIV-1 enhancer region of the long terminal repeat and contributes to the inducibility of HIV-1 <Node id="165984"/>gene expression<Node id="165999"/> in response to multiple activating agents. Phosphorylation and degradation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor I kappa B alpha are crucial regulatory events in the activation of NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity. Both N- and C-terminal residues of I kappa B alpha are required for inducer-mediated degradation. Chronic <Node id="166310"/>HIV-1 infection<Node id="166325"/> of myeloid cells leads to constitutive NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity and provides an intranuclear environment capable of perpetuating HIV-1 replication. Increased intracellular stores of latent NF-kappa B may also result in rapid inducibility of NF-kappa B-dependent cytokine <Node id="166604"/>gene expression<Node id="166619"/>. In response to secondary pathogenic infections or antigenic challenge, cytokine <Node id="166701"/>gene expression<Node id="166716"/> is rapidly induced, enhanced, and sustained over prolonged periods in HIV-1-infected myeloid cells compared with uninfected cells. Elevated levels of several inflammatory cytokines have been detected in the sera of HIV-1-infected individuals. Secretion of myeloid cell-derived cytokines may both increase virus production and contribute to AIDS-associated disorders.
8950977: In this paper we have investigated the role of Egr-1 in B cell growth regulation by examining the <Node id="167191"/>gene expression<Node id="167206"/> in a panel of B cell lines, including both EBV genome negative and EBV carrying cell lines. Egr-1 expression correlates with the cellular phenotype and the specific pattern of viral latency established within the individual cell lines. Thus, constitutive activation of Egr-1 gene is invariably associated with unrestricted expression of viral latent genes in all group III EBV genome carrying cell lines. In contrast, Egr-1 expression is abrogated in group I Burkitt tumor cells, irrespective of the EBV genome carrying status. Activated viral <Node id="167751"/>gene expression<Node id="167766"/> associated with phenotypic conversion of group I cell lines in to group II or III restores the Egr-1 <Node id="167868"/>gene expression<Node id="167883"/>. Several forms of EGR-1 protein are found within the different groups of cell lines, and the binding activity to DNA consensus sequences was investigated. Finally, time course analysis of Egr-1 expression during the early steps of EBV infection in vitro demonstrated that Egr-1 is upregulated within minutes from the initial interaction with the B lymphocyte.
9727000: <Node id="168253"/>Transcription<Node id="168266"/> factors belonging to the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family regulate the expression of cytokine genes and other inducible genes during the immune response. The functions of NFAT proteins are directly controlled by the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Here we show that the binding of calcineurin to NFAT is substantially increased when calcineurin is activated with calmodulin and calcium. FK506.FKBP12 drug-immunophilin complexes inhibited the interaction of NFAT with activated calcineurin much more effectively than they inhibited the interaction with inactive calcineurin, suggesting that part of the interaction with activated calcineurin involved the enzyme active site. We have previously shown that NFAT is targeted to inactive calcineurin at a region distinct from the calcineurin active site (Aramburu, J., Garcia-Cozar, F. J., Raghavan, A., Okamura, H., Rao, A., and Hogan, P. G. (1998) Mol. Cell 1, 627-637); this region is also involved in NFAT binding to activated calcineurin, since binding is inhibited by an NFAT peptide spanning the calcineurin docking site on NFAT. The interacting surfaces are located on the catalytic domain of the calcineurin A chain and on an 86-amino acid fragment of the NFAT regulatory domain. NFAT binding to the calcineurin catalytic domain was inhibited by the calcineurin autoinhibitory domain and the RII substrate peptide, which bind in the calcineurin active site, as well as by the NFAT docking site peptide, which binds to a region of calcineurin distinct from the active site. We propose that, in resting cells, NFAT is targeted to a region of the calcineurin catalytic domain that does not overlap the calcineurin active site. Upon cell activation, displacement of the autoinhibitory domain by calmodulin binding allows NFAT to bind additionally to the calcineurin active site, thus positioning NFAT for immediate dephosphorylation at functional phosphoserine residues.
2172422: Immunohistochemically, the immunoreaction against 5 steroid hormone anti-sera (estradiol, estriol, cortisol, progesterone and testosterone) was examined in 39 cases with the malignant soft tissue tumors (fibrosarcoma: 8, malignant fibrous histiocytoma: 6, rhabdomyosarcoma: 10, leiomyosarcoma: 10, liposarcoma: 5). Seventeen cases revealed distinct immunostaining against at least 1 of the 5 steroid hormones. Immunostained tumor cells were more frequently distributed in the area where tumor cell infiltration was more invasive. The majority of the positive cases occurred in female cases. Furthermore, the existence of estrogen receptor (estrogen binding activity) was examined histochemically in 39 cases and it was detected in 8. We concluded that steroid hormones might be closely related to tumor cell infiltration of some malignant soft tissue tumors.
8804437: The Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins function as negative regulators of DNA binding, basic helix-loop-helix proteins in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. We report here on the identification of a 17 kDa variant of the 14 kDa Id-3 protein termed Id-3L (long version) which possesses a unique 60 amino acid carboxy-terminus generated by read through of a 'coding intron' and alternative splicing. Northern analysis revealed expression of a minor 1.1 kb Id-3L transcript together with the predominant 0.95 kb Id-3 transcript in the majority of adult human tissues analysed. The variant Id-3L protein is functionally distinguishable from conventional Id-3 since in in vitro DNA mobility shift assays, it was greatly impaired in its ability to abrogate binding of the basic helix-loop-helix protein, E47, to an E box recognition sequence.
9305919: Interleukin 2 (IL-2) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 3 and 5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription). We now show that IL-2 regulation of STAT3 proteins in T cells is a complex response involving activation of two forms of STAT3: 90-kDa STAT3alpha and an 83-kDa carboxyl-terminal truncated STAT3beta. The phosphorylation of STAT proteins on serine residues is also required for competent STAT <Node id="172389"/>transcription<Node id="172402"/>. A critical serine phosphorylation site in STAT3alpha is at position 727. In this study we have produced an antisera specific for STAT3alpha proteins phosphorylated on serine 727 and used this to monitor the phosphorylation of this residue during T lymphocyte activation. Our results show that phosphorylation of STAT3alpha on serine 727 is not constitutive in quiescent T cells but can be induced by the cytokine IL-2. Interestingly, triggering of the T cell antigen receptor complex or activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters also induces phosphorylation of serine 727 but without simultaneously inducing STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or DNA binding. Hence, the present results show that STAT3 serine phosphorylation can be regulated independently of the tyrosine phosphorylation of this molecule. IL-2 and T cell antigen receptor complex induction of STAT3alpha serine 727 phosphorylation is dependent on the activity of the <Node id="173343"/>MEK/ERK pathway<Node id="173358"/>. Previous studies have identified <Node id="173393"/>H-7-sensitive kinase pathways<Node id="173422"/> that regulate STAT3 DNA binding. We show that <Node id="173469"/>H-7-sensitive pathways<Node id="173491"/> regulate STAT3 DNA binding in T cells. Nevertheless, we show that H-7-sensitive kinases do not regulate STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or phosphorylation of serine 727. These results thus show that STAT3 proteins are targets for multiple kinase pathways in T cells and can integrate signals from both cytokine receptors and antigen receptors.
8780159: Based on the presence of T cell receptor-beta (TcR-beta) gene rearrangements in L428 and HDLM-1 cells, the expression of CD2 in HDLM-1 cells, and the presence of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene rearrangement in KM-H2 cells, some researchers have concluded that these long-term cell lines derived from patients with Hodgkin's disease are lymphoid in nature. The information obtained from these cell lines has also been used in arguments for a lymphoid origin of H-RS cells in tissue despite the frequent absence of lymphoid markers and Ig/TcR gene rearrangements in these cells. We questioned whether one can use the limited expression of lymphoid markers or the limited gene rearrangement to conclude that H-RS cells have a lymphoid origin, because these markers may be aberrant in tumor cells. In this study, we examined the expression of two T-cell-specific transcription factors (TCF-1 and GATA-3) and one B-cell-specific transcription factor (BSAP) in cultured H-RS cells by using a gel mobility shift assay. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for determination of cell lineage have been established in a large number of cultured human and murine cell lines. All three types of H-RS cell lines were consistently negative for BSAP, TCF-1, and GATA-3. The absence of GATA-3 was confirmed in H-RS cells in tissues by an in situ hybridization technique. Virtually all B-cell lines, with the exception of some myeloma cell lines, are positive for BSAP, which is the transcription factor for promoters for several B-cell markers, including VpreB1, lambda 5, CD19, and CD20. All T-cell lines tested were positive for TCF-1 and GATA-3, which are the transcription factors for promoters for several T-cell-restricted markers, including CD2, CD3, TcR, and lck. The absence of BSAP, TCF-1, and GATA-3 clearly indicates an underlying difference between H-RS cells and lymphoid cells.
1347914: The v-erbA oncogene, a mutated version of the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (c-erbA/TR-alpha), inhibits erythroid differentiation and constitutively represses transcription of certain erythrocyte genes, suggesting a normal function of the proto-oncogene c-erbA in erythropoiesis. Here we demonstrate that the endogenous thyroid hormone receptor alpha (c-erbA/TR-alpha) and the closely related retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-alpha) play a role in the regulation of normal erythroid differentiation. Retinoic acid (RA) distinctly modulated the erythroid differentiation program of normal erythroid progenitors and erythroblasts reversibly transformed by a conditional tyrosine kinase oncogene. When added pulsewise to immature cells, differentiation was accelerated while more mature cells underwent premature cell death. Thyroid hormone (T3) alone caused similar but weaker effects. Interestingly, T3 strongly enhanced the action of RA, suggesting cooperative action of the two receptors in modulating erythroid differentiation. Expression of the human RAR-alpha in receptor-negative erythroblasts conferred RA-induced regulation of differentiation to the otherwise unresponsive cells, thus showing that the RAR-alpha is essential for the RA effect. Likewise, enhanced expression of exogenous c-erbA/TR-alpha in erythroblasts rendered them susceptible to modulation of differentiation by T3, suggesting a similar function of both receptors.
8430069: The long terminal repeat (LTR) of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and the 5' regulatory region of the gene encoding the interleukin 2 receptor alpha subunit (IL-2R alpha) share functional kappa B enhancer elements involved in the regulation of these inducible transcription units during T-cell activation. These kappa B enhancer elements are recognized by a structurally related family of interactive proteins that includes p50, p65, and the product of the c-rel protooncogene (c-Rel). Recent biochemical studies have shown that p65 and p50 form the prototypical NF-kappa B complex, which is rapidly translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during T-cell activation. This intracellular signaling complex potently stimulates kappa B-directed <Node id="177962"/>transcription<Node id="177975"/> from either the HIV-1 LTR or the IL-2R alpha promoter via the strong transactivation domain present in p65. We now demonstrate that nuclear expression of human c-Rel, which is induced by either phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor alpha with delayed kinetics relative to p65, markedly represses p65-mediated activation of these transcription units. These inhibitory effects of c-Rel correlate with its DNA-binding activity but not with its ability to heterodimerize with p50, suggesting that c-Rel inhibition involves competition with p50/p65 for occupancy of the kappa B enhancer element. Together, these findings suggest that one function of c-Rel is as a physiologic repressor of the HIV-1 LTR and IL-2R alpha promoters, serving to efficiently counter the strong transcriptional activating effects of p65.
9918824: Butyric acid (BA) is known to induce overexpression of fetal hemoglobin and then erythroid differentiation. Therefore, BA is currently under clinical investigation as a potential therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease and cancer. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in BA-induced differentiation remain largely unknown. Previous reports have shown that BA-induced overexpression of erythroid genes occurred at the transcriptional level, suggesting the involvement of erythroid transcription factors. Here, we intend to demonstrate the requirement of GATA-1 and NF-E2 transcription factors in the BA-induced erythroid differentiation of human leukemic K562 cells. Time-course experiments showed that nuclear levels of GATA-1 and p45 NF-E2 proteins increased during BA treatment. Moreover, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting either GATA-1 or p45 NF-E2 proteins inhibited both protein expression and BA-induced differentiation. In contrast, BA-induced cell growth inhibition was not affected. These results provide the first direct evidence for the requirement of GATA-1 and NF-E2 in BA-induced differentiation process.
9858563: Early B-cell factor (EBF) is a transcription factor suggested as essential for early B-lymphocyte development by findings in mice where the coding gene has been inactivated by homologous disruption. This makes the identification of genetic targets for this transcription factor pertinent for the understanding of early <Node id="180270"/>B-cell development<Node id="180288"/>. The lack of B29 transcripts, coding for the beta subunit of the B-cell receptor complex, in pro-B cells from EBF-deficient mice suggested that B29 might be a genetic target for EBF. We here present data suggesting that EBF interacts with three independent sites within the mouse B29 promoter. Furthermore, ectopic expression of EBF in HeLa cells activated a B29 promoter-controlled reporter construct 13-fold and induced a low level of expression from the endogenous B29 gene. Finally, mutations in the EBF binding sites diminished B29 promoter activity in pre-B cells while the same mutations did not have as striking an effect on the promoter function in B-cell lines of later differentiation stages. These data suggest that the B29 gene is a genetic target for EBF in early <Node id="181067"/>B-cell development<Node id="181085"/>.
9733836: The transition of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from latency into the lytic cycle is associated with the expression of two immediate-early viral genes, BZLF1 and BRLF1. Overexpression of ZEBRA, the product of BZLF1, is sufficient to disrupt latency in B lymphocytes and epithelial cells by stimulating expression of lytic cycle genes, including BRLF1. The BRLF1 product Rta functions as a transcriptional activator in both B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. However, Rta has recently been reported to disrupt latency in an epithelial specific manner (S. Zalani, E. Holley-Guthrie, and S. Kenney, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:9194-9199, 1996). Here we demonstrate that expression of Rta is also sufficient for disruption of latency in a permissive B-cell line. In HH514-16 cells, transfection of Rta leads to synthesis of ZEBRA, viral DNA replication, and late gene expression. However, Rta by itself is less potent than ZEBRA in the ability to activate most early and late lytic cycle genes. In light of previous work implicating ZEBRA in the activation of Rta, we suggest a cooperative model for EBV entry into the lytic cycle. Expression of either BZLF1 or BRLF1 triggers expression of the other immediate-early factor, and together these activators act individually or in synergy on downstream targets to activate the viral lytic cycle.
9315663: The retinoblastoma gene product (pRB) plays an important role in controlling both cell release from the <Node id="182546"/>G1 phase<Node id="182554"/> and <Node id="182559"/>apoptosis<Node id="182568"/>. We show here that in the early phases of <Node id="182611"/>apoptosis<Node id="182620"/>, pRB is posttranslationally modified by a tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-catalyzed reaction. In fact, by employing a novel haptenized lysis synthetic substrate which allows the isolation of glutaminyl-tTG substrates in vivo, we identified pRB as a potential tTG substrate in U937 cells undergoing <Node id="182917"/>apoptosis<Node id="182926"/>. In keeping with this finding, we showed that apoptosis of U937 cells is characterized by the rapid disappearance of the 105,000- to 110,000-molecular-weight pRB forms concomitantly with the appearance of a smear of immunoreactive products with a molecular weight of greater than 250,000. The shift in pRB molecular weight was reproduced by adding exogenous purified tTG to extracts obtained from viable U937 cells and was prevented by dansylcadaverine, a potent enzyme inhibitor. The effect of the pRB posttranslational modification during <Node id="183468"/>apoptosis<Node id="183477"/> was investigated by determining the E2F-1 levels and by isolating and characterizing pRB-null clones from U937 cells. Notably, the lack of pRB in these U937-derived clones renders these p53-null cells highly resistant to <Node id="183699"/>apoptosis<Node id="183708"/> induced by serum withdrawal, calphostin C, and ceramide. Taken together, these data suggest that tTG, acting on the pRB protein, might play an important role in the cell progression through the death program.
10364157: Malignant transformation usually inhibits terminal cell differentiation but the precise mechanisms involved are not understood. PU.1 is a hematopoietic-specific Ets family transcription factor that is required for development of some lymphoid and myeloid lineages. PU.1 can also act as an oncoprotein as activation of its expression in erythroid precursors by proviral insertion or transgenesis causes erythroleukemias in mice. Restoration of terminal differentiation in the mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells requires a decline in the level of PU.1, indicating that PU.1 can block erythroid differentiation. Here we investigate the mechanism by which PU.1 interferes with erythroid differentiation. We find that PU.1 interacts directly with GATA-1, a zinc finger transcription factor required for erythroid differentiation. Interaction between PU.1 and GATA-1 requires intact DNA-binding domains in both proteins. PU.1 represses GATA-1-mediated transcriptional activation. Both the DNA binding and transactivation domains of PU.1 are required for repression and both domains are also needed to block terminal differentiation in MEL cells. We also show that ectopic expression of PU.1 in Xenopus embryos is sufficient to block erythropoiesis during normal development. Furthermore, introduction of exogenous GATA-1 in both MEL cells and Xenopus embryos and explants relieves the block to erythroid differentiation imposed by PU.1. Our results indicate that the stoichiometry of directly interacting but opposing transcription factors may be a crucial determinant governing processes of normal differentiation and malignant transformation.
9710448: The high concentration of foreign antigen in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is separated from the underlying lymphocytes by a single cell layer of polarized epithelium. Intestinal epithelial cells can express HLA class II antigens and may function as antigen-presenting cells to CD4(+) T cells within the intestinal mucosa. Using tetanus toxoid specific and HLA-DR-restricted T lymphocytes, we show that polarized intestinal epithelial cells directed to express HLA-DR molecules are able to initiate class II processing only after internalization of antigen from their apical surface. Coexpression of the class II transactivator CIITA in these cells, which stimulates highly efficient class II processing without the characteristic decline in barrier function seen in polarized monolayers treated with the proinflammatory cytokine gamma-IFN, facilitates antigen processing from the basolateral surface. In both cases, peptide presentation to T cells via class II molecules was restricted to the basolateral surface. These data indicate a highly polarized functional architecture for antigen processing and presentation by intestinal epithelial cells, and suggest that the functional outcome of antigen processing by the intestinal epithelium is both dependent on the cellular surface at which the foreign antigen is internalized and by the underlying degree of mucosal inflammation.
1964088: Transient short-term expression of the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) leads to activation of the pleiotropic transcription factor NF-kappa B. Consistent with findings obtained with transient expression assays, we observed marked accumulation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B in the nucleus of Namalwa B lymphoid cells, which constitutively express Tax. In contrast, NF-kappa B activity was not detected in the nucleus following long-term expression of Tax in Jurkat T lymphocytes. The ability of both mitogens and cytokines to activate NF-kappa B was also blocked in Jurkat cells constitutively expressing Tax. However, the activation of other mitogen-inducible transcription factors, such as Fos and Jun, was unaffected. Thus, depending on the cellular environment, the short- and long-term effects of Tax expression can be quite different. Consequently, one function of Tax in cells infected with HTLV-I might involve cell-type-specific suppression, as opposed to activation, of distinct signal pathways. The cells lines described here should be useful for the delineation of signaling pathways utilized in the selective regulation of <Node id="188147"/>gene expression<Node id="188162"/>.
10357820: Here we show that the lymphoid lineage-determining factors Ikaros and Aiolos can function as strong transcriptional repressors. This function is mediated through two repression domains and is dependent upon the promoter context and cell type. Repression by Ikaros proteins correlates with hypo-acetylation of core histones at promoter sites and is relieved by histone deacetylase inhibitors. Consistent with these findings, Ikaros and its repression domains can interact in vivo and in vitro with the mSin3 family of co-repressors which bind to histone deacetylases. Based on these and our recent findings of associations between Ikaros and Mi-2-HDAC, we propose that Ikaros family members modulate gene expression during lymphocyte development by recruiting distinct histone deacetylase complexes to specific promoters.
2111447: To determine whether enhancer elements in addition to the highly conserved octamer (OCTA)-nucleotide motif are important for lymphoid-specific expression of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene, we have investigated the effect of mutating the binding site for a putative additional lymphoid-specific transcription factor, designated NF-microB, in the murine IgH enhancer. We demonstrate that the NF-microB-binding site plays a critical role in the IgH enhancer, because mutation of the microB DNA motif decreased transcriptional activity of the IgH enhancer in cells of the B-cell lineage but not in nonlymphoid cells. This effect was comparable to or even stronger than the effect of a mutation in the OCTA site. Moreover, combined mutation of both microB and OCTA sites further reduced enhancer activity in lymphoid cells. Interestingly, alteration of either the microB or E3 site in a 70-base-pair fragment of the IgH enhancer that lacks the binding site for OCTA abolished enhancer activity in lymphoid cells completely. Nevertheless, a multimer of the microB motif alone showed no enhancer activity. DNase footprinting analysis corroborated the functional data showing that a lymphoid-specific protein binds to the microB DNA motif. Our results suggest that the microB element is a new crucial element important for lymphoid-specific expression of the IgH gene but that interaction with another enhancer element is essential for its activity.
2026605: One of the major objectives in the study of thrombogenesis is to determine the mechanisms by which a hematopoietic progenitor is activated and committed to the megakaryocytic lineage. Recent development of primary cultures of human megakaryocytes and the molecular cloning of genes that are specific to this lineage offer the possibility of getting some insights into the genetic mechanisms that control megakaryocytopoiesis. One gene of interest is the glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb) gene; GPIIb, the alpha subunit of the platelet cytoadhesin GPIIb-IIIa, is produced in megakaryocytes at an early stage of the differentiation, whereas the other subunit of this complex, GPIIIa, is expressed in other cells. For these reasons, the 5'-flanking region of the GPIIb gene was used to identify the regions that interact with DNA-binding nuclear factors. A fragment extending from -643 to +33 is capable of controlling the tissue-specific expression of the CAT gene in transfection experiments. Within this region, we have identified several sequences that are implicated in DNA protein interactions as shown in DNAse I footprints and gel mobility shift assays. One region, centered at -54, is similar to a nuclear factor E1-binding site, and a region located at position -233 contains a CCAAT motif. Two domains centered at positions -345 and -540, respectively, bind proteins that are present in megakaryocytic cells and nonrelated cells as well. Finally, two other domains, located at positions -460 and -510, interact with proteins that are only present in megakaryocytic cells. In addition, deletion of the region containing these two domains results in a significant decrease of the promoter activity. It is very likely that these domains bind megakaryocyte-specific nuclear proteins acting as positive transcription factors.
9185506: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitic syndrome that preferentially affects medium and large-sized arteries. Glucocorticoid therapy resolves clinical symptoms within hours to days, but therapy has to be continued over several years to prevent disease relapses. It is not known whether and how glucocorticoids affect the function of the inflammatory infiltrate or why the disease persists subclinically despite chronic treatment. GCA is self-sustained in temporal arteries engrafted into SCID mice, providing a model in which the mechanisms of action and limitations of glucocorticoid therapy can be examined in vivo. Administration of dexamethasone to temporal artery-SCID chimeras for 1 wk induced a partial suppression of T cell and macrophage function as indicated by the reduced tissue concentrations of IL-2, IL-1beta, and IL-6 mRNA, and by the diminished expression of inducible NO synthase. In contrast, synthesis of IFN-gamma mRNA was only slightly decreased, and expression of TGF-beta1 was unaffected. These findings correlated with activation of the IkappaBalpha gene and blockade of the nuclear translocation of NFkappaB in the xenotransplanted tissue. Dose-response experiments suggested that steroid doses currently used in clinical medicine are suboptimal in repressing NFkappaB-mediated cytokine production in the inflammatory lesions. Chronic steroid therapy was able to deplete the T cell products IL-2 and IFN-gamma, whereas the activation of tissue-infiltrating macrophages was only partially affected. IL-1beta transcription was abrogated; in contrast, TGF-beta1 <Node id="193883"/>mRNA synthesis<Node id="193897"/> was steroid resistant. The persistence of TGF-beta1-transcribing macrophages, despite paralysis of T cell function, may provide an explanation for the chronicity of the disease, and may identify a novel therapeutic target in this inflammatory vasculopathy.
2283805: Quantitation of glucocorticoid receptors (GCR) and the study of their affinity for glucocorticosteroids (GCS) were made in peripheral blood lymphocytes of bronchial asthma (BA) patients in consideration of GCR treatment and serum levels of endogenous cortisol. It is stated that GCR of healthy controls and GCS-untreated patients outnumbered those of cortisol-dependent BA patients on hormone therapy. Following discontinuation of glucocorticoid drugs GCR count in cortisol-dependent BA tends to rise. Endogenous cortisol has no effect on GCR level estimated by 3H-triamcinolone acetonide.
9783909: To characterize further the function of the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR), we have developed stable transfectant variants of a vitamin D-responsive cell line (U937) which express either decreased or increased numbers of VDR. In this study we have analyzed changes in gene expression associated with this variable VDR expression. Initial experiments indicated that a 50% decrease in VDR levels was associated with a 2-fold increase in cell proliferation and a similar rise in c-myc mRNA expression. Further studies were carried out using differential RNA display (DD). Sequence analysis of DD products revealed two cDNAs with identity to known gene products: the catalytic sub-unit of DNA-protein kinase (DNA-PK(CS)), and the peroxisomal enzyme 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type IV (17beta-HSD IV). Northern analysis confirmed that expression of both mRNAs was reduced in cells with decreased numbers of VDR. Down-regulation of 17beta-HSD IV mRNA expression was associated with enhanced estradiol inactivation by U937 cells, suggesting a link between <Node id="195829"/>estrogenic pathways<Node id="195848"/> and cell proliferation. Further Northern analyses indicated that there was no significant change in 17beta-HSD IV or DNA-PK(CS) mRNA levels following treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, although expression of both genes varied with changes in cell proliferation. These data suggest that, in addition to its established role as a hormone-dependent trans-activator, VDR may influence <Node id="196223"/>gene expression<Node id="196238"/> by ligand-independent mechanisms.
9339356: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a 25-kDa lipocalin first identified as a protein stored in specific granules of the human neutrophil. The protein is believed to bind small lipophilic substances such as bacterial derived formylpeptides and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and might function as a modulator of inflammation. To characterize the regulation of NGAL further, we have cloned and sequenced a 5869-bp region of the NGAL gene including 1695 bp of the 5' nontranscribed region and a 3696-bp coding region encompassing seven exons and six introns. The transcriptional start sites were identified by an RNase protection assay. The NGAL gene is highly homologous to the mouse gene 24p3. NGAL was expressed in bone marrow and in tissues that are prone to exposure to microorganisms. Potential cis-acting elements were identified in the promoter region of the NGAL gene by computer analysis and include binding sites for CTF/CBP, the hematopoietic transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1, and the LPS-inducible factor NF-kappa B.
